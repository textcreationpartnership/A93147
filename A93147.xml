            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON purpoſe I would not have thee look for any thing in this paper: for, the Kingdome of heaven com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not with expectation. Yet, if any read it, he ſhall not loſe much time; for he ſhall ſoon have done: and if none read it, I have not lost much time; for, being ſhort, it was not long in doing.</p>
            <p>The deſign of it is ſuch, as I deſire the ſucceſſe of it may not differ. It is thus. The world is now old, and earthy. It is cold and dry; and hath need to be made warm with Charity, and moiſt with Repentance. And God is wont to make uſe of mans morall ſuaſion, to work himſelf effectually by. But upon whom this lot ſhall fall, whoſe lot is it to underſtand? Where is he that ſhall dip his pen in diſcretion with ſweet reproof, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did his rod in honey, to enlighten the eyes of the people, as he did his own? I dare not aske the queſtion, Maſter Jeſu is it
<pb facs="tcp:115689:3"/>I that ſhall do thee this ſervice? Could this be done by me, and were there two felicities; this ſhould be my ſecond. The men of this age rejoyce in goods, but oh the joy of doing good! <hi>Is there no balme in Gilead? is there no Phyſician there?</hi> Alas! why is there not a Colledge of Divines to conſult the publick cure of theſe ill humours? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill there be ſuch, every one may exerciſe a generall duty without any need of a revelation; and though none is bound to convert, yet every one to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though I know nothing in my ſelf towards this end, yet am I not, me thinks, thereby juſtifyed in my neglect; ſince infirmities are of uſe to Gods glory. And if he will do us the honour, to honour himſelf by them, we have reaſon to be glad that we had them for him. O my Saviour, ſince I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſerve thee with, let me ſerve thee with them.</p>
            <p>If any one then, or every one finds the defects of this piece, he ſhall not finde me to be of another opinion. Here's no depth of judgment; no ſtrength of reaſon; no curioſities of phanſie; no patneſs of hiſtory; no fringing of the margent with variety of choiſe reading. Such things I do not pretend to Others make the world more learned. Would I could make it more good.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115689:3"/>
            <p> Neither is there ſuch uſefulneſſe of exact Scholarſhip in this morality; as alſo is it not now ſo much in faſhion. Yea, it may ſeem now ſeaſonable, becauſe we have ſometimes to do with them which do not love their enemies, whereof Learning is one. So that I am in the more capacity to be loved, becauſe I have as little in me of that againſt them, as I have of malice.</p>
            <p>Let them do what they will to me, it is more then they can do to make me their enemy. <hi>Am I become your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. It is naturall to men, as the Hiſtorian notes, to hate thoſe whom they have wronged: yet is it neceſſary for Chriſtians to do well to their enemies, becauſe they love them. And if we love virtue, we hate no man: becauſe we are more afraid that men ſhould do evill, then that we ſhould ſuffer it. We do not deſire that they ſhould have their deſire upon us in our confuſion: but we do deſire to have our deſire upon them in their converſion.</p>
            <p>This Goodneſs is the theme which I would commend to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue that name without it. Certainly thoſe who have taken the ingagement of the Goſpell, ſhould be obedient to the Law. And why ſhould Righteouſneſs be ſo far from Piety, and Piety
<pb facs="tcp:115689:4"/>from Righteouſneſs in the Subject, when he is not a right Chriſtian, in whom both do not dwell together? Indeed he that hath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and no true piety, is as an Heathen: and yet he that hath but a ſhew of piety and no righteouſneſs (and he that hath no righteouſneſs, hath but a ſhew of piety) is worſe then an Heathen. Oh that we had one heart for the two Tables!</p>
            <p>Had we had this Goodneſs which is ſpoken for, we had not had a Church more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then can be ſpoken. Goodneſs is then reall, when the principle of it is in the heart, and the end of it not on earth. And had we ſo intended it, the Goſpell would not have been pleaded to deſtry Polities, or Churches. St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> rule and ſaying would have ſaved us this harm, <hi>Mali non poſſunt obeſſe bonis, ſed boni poſſunt prodeſſe malis,</hi> The bad cannot hurt the good, but the good may do good to the bad. Had we been good, we would have loved them, till they had been better; and then have loved them better, becauſe they were better: but Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not belonging to the nature of Separation, one or other.</p>
            <p>Some parts of Goodneſs I have not purſued, as Charity; which is part of our obedience to God. Indeed there is no neceſſitie any thing
<pb facs="tcp:115689:4"/>ſhould be ſpoken for this part of a clear and pure converſation. Neither needs any thing be ſaid against <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs; which doth ſo foully and enormouſly profane the temple of the holy Ghoſt; and therefore, like filth, ſhould be ſwept out with the beſome of ancient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline. It is a ſin which the Sun will not look upon; and they aſhamed to be ſeen when they do it; therefore doth not ordinarily, as other ſins, come into open rebuke: And ſince it is a ſin againſt the body, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, it makes naturally its puniſhment in it. So that I had no great reaſon to ſay much againſt this vice, whith is plainly beſtiall, but hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>So thou haſt the project of this Script: with the eaſing of my mind in the diſcharge thereof. Who can endure to ſee his Nation and the Church in the duſt before him? And why ſhould we not redeem our own miſery (may ſome thinke) when we can never be ſafe till men be good?</p>
            <p>This is all towards a Preface; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to art, ſhould be laſt made: and I was not very forward to it. Is is but as the cackling of the hen when an egge is laid; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I ſhould have made none, for here's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing laid. More might have been, it may be, had we not been driven out of our neſt. If
<pb facs="tcp:115689:5"/>any thing ſeem to be amiſſe, take it with a grain of Salt. If any thing ſmart, that is not my fault.</p>
            <p>No more. Love thy enemies; whereof I am none. And if thou doeſt love thy enemies, thou wilt certainly love him who deſires no greater favour then to think ſo well of him, as to let him do thee good.</p>
            <p>Now I leave it to thee, and thee to God. Farewell.</p>

               <p>And this <hi>goodneſs</hi> hath a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connexion with <hi>happineſs;</hi> and therefore if we do apprehend it, how can we eſcape at leaſt ſome <hi>velieties</hi> of it? For that which is neceſſary to our end, we deſire upon the ſame account.</p>
               <p>So that the ſubject of this paper is ſuch that will pleaſe every one that is in the way of happineſs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it therefore out of my way to commend it to others: for this will more impreſs it upon my ſelf, that I may have ſome benefit by the operation, though others have no benefit by the <hi>work;</hi> as he ſaid.

               <p>There is no time appointed for the commiſſion of <hi>ſinne;</hi> but <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments;</hi> and we have had them ſorely upon us; and one would think we ſhould now have leſs of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have had ſuch a meaſure of <hi>puniſhments.</hi>

               <p>We have had fair occaſions of being wiſe and diſcreet, and prudent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115689:7"/>to preſerve our contentment; and have thought it fit not to be heart of Oak, but to be flexible and moveable with the windes: we have taken a full proportion of the <hi>wiſdom of the Serpent,</hi> and more then will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the <hi>innocency of the Dove.</hi> The <hi>Serpent</hi> hath too much beguiled the <hi>Dove.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115689:7"/>of ſin,</hi> but <hi>gloried in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> but we are contrary; for we <hi>groan</hi> under <hi>afflictions,</hi> and do rather <hi>glory in our ſhame.</hi> It is like S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that 7, chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> doth ſpeak of himſelf regenerated: for <hi>ſin</hi> in ſtate of nature is in us as in its <hi>proper place;</hi> and we do not <hi>feel</hi> it: And ſo it hath been with us. And whatſoever we have loſt, we have kept this: we have loved it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ours.</p>
               <p>We have had within the ſpace of few years many books imprinted; wherein <hi>Civil</hi> cauſes and ſome <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> cauſes have been toſſed and agitated on this ſide and on that; that we might be ſetled in our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or moved to our former term: but have not found many books written to make us <hi>right</hi> ſpiritually; and to make us better; many <hi>good books;</hi> but how many of <hi>goodneſs?</hi> I hope more then I have ſeen: but more would be ſeen.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115689:8"/>
               <p> And yet if there were more, and ſeen, and read, and <hi>got by heart,</hi> yet how ſhall we <hi>get</hi> them <hi>into the heart?</hi> Oh, how odd and awk is the nature of man to this goodneſs! It will not come alone to us: yea when we are in a manner driven to it by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, we are ready to run away from it, as if we could not be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but with it.</p>
               <p>And therefore I am afraid I ſhall not pleaſe all, becauſe I ſhall ſpeak for that which doth not. We do not like to hear of that we have no minde to follow: we are offended with it <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>by reflexion</hi> from others. And others are our enemies becauſe we are not good; whereas we ſhould not be enemies to others, though they be bad.</p>
               <p>But this doth not make a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impediment of this little enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; for he that <hi>pleaſeth all,</hi> hath no ſmall danger of <hi>Chriſts woe;</hi> and of <hi>Gods curſe</hi> for not <hi>pleaſing one,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115689:8"/>namely <hi>him:</hi> And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have enemies, we ſhould be encouraged; for we have <hi>the more to conquer,</hi> as one ſaid.</p>
               <p>And yet we have further encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>And who is there that will hurt you, if you follow that which is good?</hi> Or ſhall we be harmed becauſe we <hi>write</hi> of that which is <hi>good?</hi> May we <hi>do</hi> it, and not <hi>write</hi> it? This is ſpoken of in our own defence.</p>
               <p>Had we taken in hand ſome thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie buſineſs about the ſubject and change of <hi>Civil Power,</hi> we might have incurred ſome danger in way of right and righteouſneſs: but ſince all the matter we would have is <hi>goodneſs,</hi> we have no cauſe to fear any but thoſe who have no minde to think it to be neceſſary for them to be good, unleſs they can get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by it in this life.</p>
               <p>And if any one will conceive, that this is a Theme to meddle with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115689:9"/>not for any but ſome of thoſe who are a great deal <hi>better:</hi> I ſhall make my apology eaſily. With all my heart am I contented that others ſhould goe before me in this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I would be willing to follow their ſteps in holineſs, although in the <hi>order of the Church</hi> they go not that way, which more have gone to heaven in, then are like to do by any other.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I have nothing in me of goodneſs, I have more need to ſpeak for it, upon my own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; neither can any one keep away from me this right and liberty of good <hi>options</hi> for my ſelf and others. The time and utmoſt bound of <hi>goodneſs</hi> is to be <hi>in heaven.</hi> And to this pitch ſhould every one <hi>aſcend.</hi> And the aſcent of this <hi>glory</hi> is by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> This <hi>goodneſs</hi> is the <hi>milky way</hi> to <hi>Jupiters</hi> Palace. To ſtrengthen you in it, take not this <hi>morning milk,</hi> but ſome <hi>morning me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.</hi>

               <p>O Thou bleſſed <hi>Daughter of Heaven,</hi> where ſhall we finde thee in thy eſſentials that we might define thee? or how ſhall we give thee a proper <hi>definition,</hi> when thou art a <hi>tranſcendent?</hi> It is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee to have the nature of a <hi>ſingte virtue,</hi> but thou muſt have <hi>many</hi> to thy <hi>complexion.</hi> Thou art not a virtue of <hi>one denomination,</hi> but art truly <hi>Catholick.</hi> If thou ſhouldſt be any one herb, thou ſhouldſt be <hi>grace;</hi> or as that <hi>Heliotrope</hi> amongſt flowers, which conſtantly followeth the motion of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> but thou art a <hi>compound</hi> of moſt wholeſome hearbs; and a <hi>poſie</hi> of moſt delicate flowers. Thou art not a <hi>Star,</hi> but a <hi>Conſtellation.</hi> Thou art often <hi>private,</hi> but never <hi>alone. The Virgins that be her fellows ſhall bear her company,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks.</p>

               <p> He that is not good in <hi>all</hi> virtues is good in <hi>none;</hi> but this is an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality</hi> by conſequence, and holds true even unto ſingular virtues; ſince there is the ſame root and reaſon of all. But this <hi>goodneſs</hi> is a general virtue in the very nature of it, as we commonly underſtand it; as it is ſaid of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that it is <hi>every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
                  <q>—<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</q> Namely, becauſe the <hi>legal justice</hi> doth order all acts of other virtues unto the publick civil good. And as it is ſaid by Divines of <hi>holineſs,</hi> that it doth direct and determine all actions unto a divine end, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; even ſo is <hi>goodneſs</hi> an univerſal virtue, which doth apply and diſpoſe all the operations to a good end; although it hath ſome more reſpect to <hi>charity,</hi> as <hi>holineſs</hi> hath unto <hi>piety,</hi> if we conſider them more ſtrictly. Strictly indeed ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> before our Saviours
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115689:10"/>Incarnation did take the notion of it, when they diſtinguiſhed, for morality, men into three ſorts; ſome <hi>wicked,</hi> ſome <hi>juſt,</hi> ſome <hi>good.</hi> So is interpreted moſt-what their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And theſe three kindes of men had their kindes of ſayings: the firſt this, <hi>That which is mine is mine, and that which is thine is mine.</hi> And what then are they amongſt us which in effect ſay as much, that all belongs to them; and no body hath any right to any thing but they? The ſecond ſort ſaid thus; <hi>That which is mine is mine, and that which is thine is thine.</hi> The third ſort ſaid thus; <hi>That which is thine is thine, and that which is mine is thine:</hi> they would not take away from others, but would give unto others; theſe were the <hi>good men.</hi> And to this diſtinction of men, as is thought by ſome, St. <hi>Paul</hi> alledes for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Gods love to us by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 7, 8. <hi>For ſcarcely
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115689:11"/>for a juſt man will one dye; yet for a good man one peradventure would even dare to dye: but God commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his love to us in that when we were ſinners,</hi> (wicked) <hi>Chriſt dyed for us. Yet for a good man</hi> (which is more then <hi>juſt</hi>) <hi>one it may be would dare to dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was their notion then of <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> in a ſupereminence to <hi>justice</hi> in the reſtraint of acception. We ſhall ſpeak of it here more largely as it hath it ſelf in every virtue, not as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any, but as running through all. For this is a very buſie thing, and will have a hand and ſomewhat to do in every action, if it be in men, as at <hi>home.</hi> O that it were at <hi>home!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is too much a ſtranger with us; and will ſcarce ſtay ſo long with us as to have the <hi>picture</hi> of it taken. And we cannot take <hi>meaſure</hi> of it to fit it with ſutable conceits and <hi>terms.</hi> It will not be familiar to underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, until we have it in fruition of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115689:11"/>God. We cannot here get enough of it for our uſe. It <hi>runs away</hi> as it were from us, becauſe we do not give it <hi>good entertainment.</hi> But let us <hi>follow</hi> it, that we may <hi>overtake</hi> it. And let us ſo carry our ſelves as to be accounted at leaſt <hi>well wiſhers</hi> to it. It will not be <hi>marryed</hi> in this life: yet we may <hi>love</hi> it. It is like <hi>Truth,</hi> which is always a <hi>Virgin,</hi> though ſome would corrupt her, and have her proper to them: ſo is <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> always ſingle; not as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many virtues of the ſame <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> but no <hi>husband.</hi> Some, like the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> would have it go along al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together with them, and not ſo much as look upon any other which is not of their Congregation. But <hi>goodneſs</hi> never <hi>took parts:</hi> It is for <hi>practiſe,</hi> not for <hi>faction:</hi> It goes right on; it loves no ſides; and thoſe who would have it belong to their party, they are not yet acquainted with its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; which is, to be loved of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115689:12"/>all. It ſhould have all <hi>corrivals;</hi> but in love, not only to it, but one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>He that would not have others to be eſteemed virtuous, would have ſuch wares in his ſhop only, that ſo he might have all the cuſtome and more price for them. <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> doth not love to be outblazed. Nor doth a <hi>Sect</hi> endure to be outſhined in a ſhew of ſanctity.</p>
               <p>But how little hath he of <hi>goodneſs</hi> that hath none of <hi>charity!</hi> and how little hath he of <hi>charity,</hi> that thinks what others have he hath not, and what he hath others have not! He that ſhrinketh and pincheth this goodneſs into a <hi>ſeparate confederacy,</hi> leſſeneth the Church of Chriſt by many, and is in danger of not <hi>eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others better then himſelf</hi> (which is the precept of the Apoſtle) and ſo is in peril of leſſening the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church by himſelf.</p>
               <p>He that phanſieth he cannot be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115689:12"/>
                  <hi>good,</hi> unleſs others be <hi>naught;</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>naught</hi> becauſe others are <hi>good.</hi> As if we were injurious to other mens credits, becauſe we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to be as good as they, not in hatred or envy of them, but in love of virtue: As if we might not build higher in good works, becauſe our ſuperſtructure ſtands in their light.</p>
               <p>Oh! let us take heed of ſuch <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations:</hi> we had better impropriate <hi>Tithes</hi> then <hi>Goodneſs:</hi> for every part of goodneſs is holy to God. And this belongs to every one to have.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me not love good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if I would not have it more common, then it is, or ſome would think ſo. But ſince thou art like <hi>glory</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> communicable to <hi>all</hi> without detriment to <hi>any,</hi> let me not imagine that I can have the leſs, becauſe others have more: but let me have more, becauſe I would have others have more.</p>

               <p> And ſince, O bleſſed Saviour, out of thy pierced ſide did flow both <hi>bloud</hi> to pardon, and <hi>water</hi> to cleanſe; let the bloud, if thou pleaſeſt, be as <hi>large</hi> as the <hi>worth</hi> of it; and let the water be as <hi>common,</hi> as <hi>common water.</hi> I ſhall fare the better by the <hi>Communion of Saints:</hi> and am likely to be <hi>more good,</hi> if <hi>more be good.</hi> Oh, let me not be near the Devil in <hi>envie</hi> of good, leſt I be ever with him, and always envy it. But let me be like unto thee, O Lord, who art <hi>good to all,</hi> and wouldſt have <hi>all good.</hi> So make me good to all, as much as may be; and contented to be the worſt of all the world; not by my <hi>badneſs,</hi> but by <hi>others excellency.</hi> And becauſe the World is now in its <hi>decrepit age,</hi> and <hi>ready to be diſſolved,</hi> make it, O bleſſed God, before its end mindefull of its end; that it may not goe out in a <hi>blaze</hi> of hypocriſie, or a <hi>ſtench</hi> of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

               <p>THat which doth <hi>exceed</hi> by way of eminence, doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe under it that which is <hi>exceeded.</hi> As <hi>ingenuity</hi> ſuperaddeth to <hi>juſtice:</hi> it is ſo much and ſomewhat more. As the <hi>rational ſoul</hi> doth include the others. And upon this account, as <hi>piety</hi> doth include <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>temperance;</hi> ſo doth alſo <hi>goodneſs.</hi> And therefore thus have we reaſon not to paſs by the conſideration of this morality in the matter of it, if we did underſtaand <hi>goodneſs</hi> in that perfection. But we take it here as it doth diffuſe it ſelf over other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and hath ſomewhat of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them all. And therefore in this regard alſo, muſt we not baulk the conſideration both of <hi>temperance</hi> and of <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> And becauſe others are more negligent of them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115689:14"/>therefore we muſt not; if we would have our ſelves and others better. But thus certainly hath the Devill gulled and deluded the mindes of men which are not mortified, with a conceit, that if they exerciſe themſelves in outward holineſs of actions towards God, they need take no great care of any other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>That which excelleth other things makes thoſe things inferiour to ſeem not to be at all; which is the ground of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> rule of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture many times a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> in a <hi>negative;</hi> but it doth not make that which is excelled not to be at all: and therefore it is to be underſtood by a comparative. As for inſtance, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> ſaith God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. not that God did <hi>forbid ſacrifice;</hi> for that was yet a commanded ſervice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; but he would <hi>have mercy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115689:14"/>rather then ſacrifice,</hi> as it is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the following words, <hi>and the knowledge of God rather then,</hi> or <hi>more then burnt offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe who would be eſteemed ſuch as doe believe in God and Chriſt, ſhould not believe that it doth become them to ſeparate any virtue from <hi>piety:</hi> as if becauſe other virtues were ſuppoſed in <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> therefore they might be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. They are ſunk in the notion of <hi>piety:</hi> but they muſt appear in the <hi>ſubject.</hi> If they be not all to be found in the ſame <hi>Congregation,</hi> yet they are of the ſame <hi>Combination.</hi> If we take <hi>holineſs</hi> in ſuch a real ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction as to take away that which is anothers without any loſs of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we deceive two together, <hi>our neighbor,</hi> and <hi>our ſelves.</hi> And at length we ſhall have the worſt: for their loſs will be but of their <hi>goods,</hi> but we ſhall loſe our <hi>ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he that will imagin he may

               <p>But are there any in all the world of Chriſtians that can have any ſuch imagination? One would think not: and yet thus we muſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them by their converſation.</p>
               <p>Therefore a ſober word or two we muſt put in for <hi>temperance:</hi> and a juſt admonition for <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will begin with <hi>temperance,</hi> that we may better underſtand the practiſe of <hi>righteouſneſs:</hi> for while we are under the command of this vice, we are not in capacity to be righteous. When we have taken too much, are we then fit to give every one his own? Indeed when we have taken too much of the creature, we are unrighteous unto God, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould ſeem to begin firſt with

               </p>
               <p>Whereof we can hardly ſpeak without exceſs, when we are to ſpeak of it. And yet we need not ſay much againſt them, for when they are to be blamed, they can ſay nothing for themſelves; but every word they ſpeak betrayeth the fault.</p>
               <p>This is one of the vices betwixt which and Chriſtianity there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be an incompoſſibility. <hi>Temperance</hi> is one of the virtues, which in Chriſtians ſhould have no contrary. A Chriſtian is I know not how many <hi>fourms</hi> above it. He is deep in his <hi>Bible,</hi> and in <hi>practical Divinity,</hi> if not <hi>myſtical;</hi> whereas he that is learning <hi>temperance,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet ſpeak his letters right. What? is their <hi>ſoul</hi> of uſe to them only for <hi>ſalt</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>to keep their bodies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115689:16"/>from rotting?</hi> But what have they to keep their <hi>ſouls</hi> from rotting? not one grain of ſalt. <hi>Intemperance</hi> is that ſin which ſhould have no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment preſcribed, like <hi>paricide,</hi> becauſe it ſhould be thought no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would commit it; and becauſe if it be committed, it makes its own puniſhment. Were there neither <hi>Scripture</hi> nor <hi>Religion,</hi> there is in <hi>Reaſon</hi> reaſon enough againſt <hi>intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> of one or the other kinde; for both go into the paunch. And if I would make any part of me a God, it ſhould not be the <hi>Belly;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſo eaſily paſſeth into the account of the <hi>Dunghil gods.</hi> And thus we ſhould be without doubt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the vice, and the more we took in, the more we ſhould magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Divinity. <hi>God deliver me,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Arabian, from him that kils his King, and eats his God:</hi> and certainly he is not far from <hi>eating his god</hi> who hath his Divinity in his <hi>ſenſitive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115689:16"/>appetite;</hi> and puts his god in his <hi>bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> as the <hi>covetous</hi> man puts him in his <hi>pocket.</hi> He that is of this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to have his god thus alwayes about him, and in him, is he not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> when he is <hi>hungry,</hi> and is he not <hi>Zealous</hi> when he is <hi>thirſty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>glutton</hi> hath his <hi>ſacrificing knife</hi> alſo. Every knife to him is ſuch; his <hi>trencher</hi> is his <hi>Altar;</hi> his <hi>Sacrifices, meat-offerings</hi> of all ſorts; and his Sacrifices are <hi>ſalted:</hi> but he hath alſo his Sacrifices of <hi>fiſh.</hi> The nidor of the meat is his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</hi> He is his own <hi>Prieſt;</hi> but his <hi>Cook</hi> is his <hi>Levite,</hi> and the heat of his ſtomach is the <hi>fire</hi> that conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his <hi>bnrnt-offerings.</hi> The <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> hath his <hi>drink-offerings,</hi> and extendeth his religion beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: The Pſalmiſt ſaid he would <hi>take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord:</hi> but he taketh the <hi>cup of damnation,</hi> and in effect calleth upon the name of the <hi>Devil.</hi>

                  <hi>falſe Alarum</hi> to betray men? or to catch men as we do birds with a <hi>falſe call;</hi> or as a <hi>clapper</hi> to toll men to their deſtruction? Is our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage given us to tell others what is not? Let all the <hi>letters</hi> be <hi>mutes,</hi> and the <hi>hedge of our teeth</hi> for ever <hi>quick-ſet,</hi> if our <hi>heart</hi> be not always at our <hi>mouth</hi> when we anſwer or promiſe; when we are to ſay what is, or what we will do. Or let our tongue for ever <hi>keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doores,</hi> rather then it ſhould go our to deceive our neighbour. Hath God made our ſpeech to paſs through ſo many inſtruments, that we ſhould make nothing of a <hi>lye?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>paint</hi> of <hi>outward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> ſhall melt at the <hi>fire</hi> of Gods <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and the frame of Nature taken apieces, and every thing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the gloſs which is ſet upon bad actions will go off, every thing will be <hi>naked</hi> in its principles; and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115689:28"/>
                  <hi>lying</hi> will be then found to be worſe then <hi>ſwearing,</hi> in ſeveral regards. 1. Becauſe <hi>ſwearing</hi> is not abſolutely <hi>unlawful.</hi> If it be in the <hi>right form,</hi> upon <hi>due occaſion,</hi> and the <hi>object</hi> be <hi>God,</hi> it is an act of Religion: but there is no right form of <hi>lying;</hi> there can be no <hi>juſt occaſion;</hi> there is no <hi>object</hi> for it: it is againſt <hi>judgement, truth,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> We ought not therefore to ly, though thereby we could ſave a world; although what ſo frequent as to tell a lye, to ſave or get a farthing?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lying</hi> is worſe becauſe it is more <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> For it is oppoſite to the principles of <hi>beeing.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the ſame thing ſhould <hi>be</hi> and <hi>not be,</hi> is a prime principle: now the <hi>lye,</hi> in the nature of it, doth thwart this principle: for it would make the matter of the lye to be and not to be. As in the example of <hi>Gehezi,</hi> the Prophet asked him <hi>where he had been,</hi> he ſaid <hi>he went
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115689:28"/>no whither;</hi> here was the lye, he ſpake contrary to the thing known, for he did go after <hi>Naaman</hi> for his advantage. That he did go, was true in the <hi>fact;</hi> and that he did not go, he would have true in his <hi>word:</hi> and ſo the effect of the <hi>lye</hi> is, to have both the parts of the <hi>contradiction</hi> true, that he did go, and he did not go. And if this might be granted, it would unravel all the world, and we could not affirm God or any thing. This is the minde of going againſt our minde in ſpeech: ſo it is repugnant to prime principles, and the prime verity, who <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is more hainous, becauſe it is more <hi>deſtructive</hi> of all <hi>communion</hi> with men: <hi>ſwearing</hi> is not in it ſelf deſtructive, but is, if duely perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of uſe to preſerve the rights of men, in their good name, or eſtate, or life; as when an <hi>Oath</hi> is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>lawful Judge,</hi> for the <hi>ending of debates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115689:29"/> 4. God <hi>cannot lye,</hi> for it is <hi>ſin;</hi> and therefore he cannot do it; and all in him is beeing, and therefore he cannot <hi>lye;</hi> but God hath <hi>ſworn</hi> in his wrath, <hi>if they ſhall enter into his reſt,</hi> as in the 95. <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe <hi>lying</hi> is an act, as we may ſpeak, of <hi>filial obedience</hi> to the god of this world, the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the <hi>Father of a lye,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>He was a lyer from the beginning,</hi> and ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed man. And that which is <hi>ſymbolical</hi> to the <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> is like to be a <hi>chief ſin.</hi> We do not read of the <hi>Devils ſwearing:</hi> for they have no minde to do that which upon any conditions ſhould be a <hi>religious act;</hi> and alſo men will believe him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſwearing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This ſin of <hi>lying</hi> was <hi>odious</hi> to the very <hi>Heathens;</hi> and as odious as <hi>hell,</hi> was he that <hi>ſaid one thing</hi> and <hi>meant another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So haynous this vice is, which I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115689:29"/>have not taken ſuch notice of, as if I would favour <hi>ſwearing;</hi> for I ſhall give it its correction in its due place. But I have given it the ſharper cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe it <hi>deſerves</hi> it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more <hi>common,</hi> and more <hi>abominable</hi> in thoſe who abominate <hi>Oaths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were there any <hi>Chriſtian bloud</hi> running in our veins, we would <hi>bluſh</hi> at ſuch enormity, which, had we not been Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> we might have ſcorned. Can we make any pretence of intereſt in the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> when there is <hi>no truth in us?</hi> Let us not therefore any longer diſhonour the faith of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in making that to be a <hi>cloak</hi> of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which when we <hi>put</hi> it <hi>on,</hi> was made to ſignifie that we would <hi>put off lyes. Lye not one to another, ſince you have put off the old man with his works; and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Image of him that created
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115689:30"/>him;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. When God <hi>created</hi> the world, he <hi>ſaw all things good,</hi> which ſuppoſeth them to be conformable to his forms of them in his own minde: and when God <hi>re-creates,</hi> renews man, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him this principle to ſhew himſelf conformable outwardly to the image and types of things in his own minde.</p>
               <p>If an <hi>Heathen</hi> ſhould <hi>lye</hi> unto me, he ſhould deceive me, becauſe I look for <hi>truth</hi> from him upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>reaſon:</hi> but if a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> tels me a <hi>lye,</hi> he deceiveth me more, becauſe that worthy and holy name, wherewith he is recommended to my belief, maketh me to preſume that he will be <hi>true</hi> to his <hi>profeſsion,</hi> and to me. And therefore though it be not unlawful for Chriſtians, when the caſe is duly put, to <hi>ſwear:</hi> yet me thinks he ſhould not be urged to any other form, then upon his honour. The <hi>word of a Chriſtian</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115689:30"/>makes a kinde of <hi>ſpiritual oath:</hi> and although he doth not touch the <hi>book,</hi> yet it is made by it; yea the <hi>Chriſtians word</hi> ſhould be more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible then another mans <hi>oath:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Chriſtians word</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an internal principle of <hi>ſincerity;</hi> the other mans <hi>oath</hi> may be cauſed by ſome extrinſecal end.</p>
               <p>To ſay no more, it is time for the whole world to <hi>ſhut up ſhop,</hi> if there be no hold of mens words. And we might make it a queſtion, whether, if the <hi>laws</hi> of men were punctually to be accommodated to the uſe of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> there ſhould not be as great a puniſhment for a <hi>lye,</hi> as for a <hi>ſtealth;</hi> ſince ſome <hi>lyes</hi> are redundantly more injurious to the <hi>Publique</hi> then ſome <hi>ſtealths.</hi> Had we not as good take the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the Firmament, as take away <hi>righteouſneſs?</hi> and <hi>truth of words</hi> is organical to <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in actions.</hi> It is no matter whether the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines or not, if by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115689:31"/>the <hi>light</hi> of mens <hi>words</hi> we cannot ſee what is, or what they mean. This baſe <hi>falſity</hi> leaves us more in the <hi>dark,</hi> ſo that we know not where to ſet a ſure ſtep in any <hi>civil courſe.</hi> And it came from the <hi>Prince of darkneſs,</hi> and it will return thither again to be puniſhed with him, and by him, who in envy to God brought it into the world, that he might make the world as bad as himſelf, who <hi>abode not in the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay of them who are more to be <hi>believed</hi> when they do not <hi>promiſe</hi> you; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and proteſt with high devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>deceive</hi> you: whom, when they have ſpoken, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>backwards,</hi> as we do read ſome <hi>verſes,</hi> and ſome <hi>languages.</hi> We are never <hi>right,</hi> unleſs we read them <hi>wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let ſuch for their congruous and condign puniſhment be baniſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115689:31"/>
                  <hi>deſerts,</hi> where they ſhall have none to deceive; or let them be amongſt men, but not allowed to ſpeak a word, untill they will ſpeak ſo, as one may <hi>underſtand them</hi> by their <hi>words,</hi> and not their <hi>words</hi> by <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh blemiſhes, and ſpots, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reproaches of the <hi>Chriſtian name!</hi> Change your <hi>name,</hi> or your <hi>manners.</hi> Or if you will not do as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould, there is another name which would more become you, and by which you would be better known; ſurely <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such took their Inſtitution for theſe two ends; to teach <hi>Grammar</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and how they have performed their duties, you may learn by their <hi>Diſciples:</hi> for they have taught the world a <hi>new Leſſon</hi> and a <hi>new Goſpel.</hi> They can learn you to <hi>ſpeak ſo,</hi> as if you <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> them <hi>ſo,</hi> you are <hi>undone.</hi> And if you do not think that they <hi>think</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:115689:32"/>ſomewhat contrary to what they <hi>ſay,</hi> they will think you are not like to be <hi>Politicians;</hi> and therefore for their turn, that you may be ridden like <hi>Engliſh Catholiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such variety of <hi>juſtice</hi> we now meet with in theſe rare and glorious times, wherein there is ſuch uſe made of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as never before. Wherein we have more <hi>liberty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more <hi>Maſters:</hi> and are bound to rejoyce that we have the <hi>freedom</hi> to keep our <hi>money</hi> till they <hi>call</hi> for it. O <hi>Saints ſuperlative!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are there not ſuch in the world? Is it not more difficult to <hi>name</hi> them then to <hi>finde</hi> them? And if ſuch be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who would be <hi>ſaved?</hi> are theſe the men that with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>look not after thoſe things which are ſeen, but thoſe things which are not ſeen?</hi> Is it not the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> to colour the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage with ſhews of holineſs for the more expedite proſecution
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115689:32"/>of <hi>unrighteouſneſs;</hi> either in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>commodity,</hi> or the <hi>price,</hi> or the <hi>weight,</hi> or the <hi>meaſure,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that are <hi>juſt,</hi> are not in other things <hi>good;</hi> but all that are <hi>good,</hi> are certainly <hi>juſt:</hi> for <hi>grace</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the principle of <hi>reaſon,</hi> doth alwayes ſuppoſe it; and therefore if we judge theſe men by their actions, they are not right: if we feel their <hi>pulſe,</hi> they are not <hi>ſound</hi> Chriſtians. If thoſe who do not <hi>good works</hi> ſhall not <hi>enter into heaven,</hi> what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe who do <hi>evil works?</hi> as the Father ſaid, Can thoſe look to <hi>live in heaven,</hi> by whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>live on earth?</hi> May thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an <hi>heavenly inheritance</hi> to be <hi>given</hi> them, who can <hi>take away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances on earth</hi> from them to whom they were <hi>given?</hi> What pity it is that it ſhould be poſſible to be ſaid by any, Had it not been for ſuch a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I had not been <hi>undone?</hi>

               <p>TO this commendation of <hi>temperance</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> might now be annexed ſome anſwer to ſome queſtions about <hi>Morality.</hi> The queſtions may be two or three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether <hi>morality</hi> in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> was ſufficient to <hi>happineſs.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſhould be the cauſe, why ſo many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are ſo much negligent of <hi>morality,</hi> unto which, <hi>reaſon,</hi> as ſuch, even after the <hi>fall,</hi> may direct and diſpoſe.</p>
               <p>Briefly of all, ſpecially of the two firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether <hi>morality</hi> in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> was ſufficient to their <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This indeed would deſerve a juſt and full volume; but I ſhall not go far or deep in it. Some of the Primitive Eccleſiaſtique Writers made great reckoning of this <hi>mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in two regards; firſt, as retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reſpect to their <hi>old principles</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as having been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them Philoſophers: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they might more freely diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Manichees:</hi> ſo that they ſpeak very liberally of thoſe who live <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115689:35"/>to <hi>happineſſe</hi> with God.</p>
               <p>Our anſwer hereunto we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in ſeveral propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Morality</hi> is in <hi>it ſelf</hi> highly laudable; as alſo in order to <hi>publique uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe who have been ſtudious of <hi>morality,</hi> ſhall certainly have <hi>leſs puniſhment;</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> determins the caſe; <hi>Fabritius</hi> ſhall be leſs puniſhed then <hi>Catiline; Non quia magis bonus, ſed quia minus malus;</hi> not becauſe he was <hi>more good,</hi> but becauſe he was <hi>leſs evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We cannot tell what <hi>mercy</hi> may be laid up in him, in whom are <hi>hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledg;</hi> &amp; therefore we cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his infinite wiſdome and knowledge doth not know, though it be ſecret to us, ſome way of applying the <hi>benefit of his death</hi> even unto thoſe of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> who lived <hi>orderly.</hi> And if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115689:35"/>they ſhall not be condemned for their <hi>unbelief,</hi> as is generally believed of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we cannot ſay that the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged unto ſome of them who have been careful to live regularly to ſuch laws as they found within them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have not done <hi>optimum quod ſic,</hi> as no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ever did live proportionably to his <hi>principles.</hi> And if the <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſecretly ſprinkled upon <hi>Infants,</hi> who cannot <hi>know Chriſt;</hi> ſome would think it may as well be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the merit of it to ſome of <hi>age,</hi> who have not <hi>known Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 4. We muſt leave this <hi>in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi> and refer them to God: To <hi>their own Maſter they stand</hi> or <hi>fall.</hi> We can conclude no otherwiſe then according to the minde of God in his Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>For there is not ſalvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſaved:</hi> no other name
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115689:36"/>
                  <hi>given amongſt men;</hi> or, <hi>given for men,</hi> as it may be rendred by an <hi>Enallage</hi> of the prepoſition; which doth abſolutely exclude any other cauſe or author of ſalvation. So that if any of them be ſaved, they muſt be ſaved by the merits of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But it is not neceſſary to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſay any more of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, unleſs we could determin it <hi>affirmatively.</hi> Then it would ſerve us for an infinite motive unto this <hi>morality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet the ſecond query, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>morality</hi> is to be accounted of by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> we may and ought to put an affirmative to: and we ſhall make up the anſwer in ſome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Morality, ut ſic,</hi> is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, even in its native rational principles: as whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to any <hi>rational principles</hi> hath a <hi>pulchritude</hi> and beauty natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally belonging thereunto. And thus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115689:36"/>all <hi>moral actions</hi> are good in their kinde, as being ſolid and true to <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame actions <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> which do in <hi>Heathens</hi> refer to <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> are to be done by <hi>Christians</hi> through the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an higher principle; namely <hi>grace;</hi> which directeth the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> by a greater <hi>light;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth the <hi>will</hi> by an higher <hi>motive of obedience</hi> to God therein. So that the matter of the <hi>morality,</hi> which reſpects the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> is to be exerciſed by principles of the <hi>firſt:</hi> and it is to be done out of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God, fear</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> So <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Brethren, <hi>Do this, for I fear God, Gen.</hi> 42.18. He doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate <hi>fair dealing</hi> towards them by his <hi>fear of God:</hi> and therefore obedience to God in <hi>temperance</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> do come under the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the leſſons thereof, as we have it clearly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115689:37"/>by St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath appeared to all men, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, godlily and righteouſly in this preſent world,</hi> &amp;c. to the end of the chapter, where we have the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> to make men <hi>zealous of good works:</hi> and if the uſe of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> be to make men zealous of <hi>good</hi> works; ſurely then it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to make men zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of <hi>juſt</hi> works.</p>
               <p>Therefore 3. Although the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> as ſuch, is above <hi>morality,</hi> as reſulting from the <hi>dictates</hi> of meer <hi>reaſon;</hi> yet the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as ſuch, is not above <hi>morality</hi> in the matter of <hi>obedience</hi> to God in the <hi>duties</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Table.</hi> He is to do them alſo with diligence and care, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth them upon an higher account. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the ſame <hi>legiſlative
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115689:37"/>authority</hi> in the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> as in the <hi>firſt.</hi> He that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother;</hi> thy <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Parents. He that forbad all <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fornication</hi> in falſe worſhip, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad alſo all <hi>carnal fornication.</hi> He that in the affirmative included doth command all <hi>worſhip</hi> to him, doth alſo command us to give whatſoever is <hi>due</hi> to our <hi>neighbour.</hi> He that hath injoyned us not to <hi>ſwear,</hi> hath alſo forbidden us to <hi>deceive our neighbour</hi> by <hi>lying</hi> or <hi>ſtealth,</hi> or any kinde of <hi>frand.</hi> He that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us <hi>not to take the Name of the Lord in vain,</hi> hath alſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us not to <hi>bear falſe witnes againſt our neighbor.</hi> He that commanded to <hi>keep holy the Sabbath,</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded alſo <hi>not to covet.</hi> So that all the laws of the ſecond Table come under the account and rate of the ſame ſervice to God. They
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115689:38"/>have the inforcement of the <hi>ſame Author;</hi> and the <hi>object perſon</hi> of their obedience is the <hi>ſame,</hi> namely <hi>God;</hi> although they <hi>differ</hi> in their <hi>matter,</hi> and in the <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>matter:</hi> for the <hi>firſt Table</hi> hath <hi>God</hi> the object of the matter thereof; the <hi>ſecond</hi> hath <hi>man</hi> for the object of the matter: but <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of obedience in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Table too; becauſe he <hi>gives the law.</hi> And therefore though <hi>man</hi> be the <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>external act,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>internal act,</hi> wherein the <hi>formal</hi> conſideration of <hi>obedience</hi> doth conſiſt, And if we do not theſe actions towards men which are contained in the <hi>ſecond Table</hi> in the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>love</hi> of him, and in <hi>reſpect</hi> to him, we do them not in way of <hi>obedience,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome other reſpect. And ſo in regard of <hi>author,</hi> in regard of <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and in regard of <hi>end,</hi> the whole law is one <hi>copulative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>morality,</hi> in the <hi>matter</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:115689:38"/>of it, is worthy of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and it becometh him well, becauſe it is more difficult for him to perform the outward acts of <hi>it,</hi> then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of the <hi>firſt Table,</hi> upon two conſiderations; Firſt, becauſe the obedience to the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> in ſome Commandements at leaſt, workes againſt <hi>carnal luſt;</hi> whereas there is no carnal luſt which doth work againſt the obedience to the <hi>firſt Table,</hi> in the outward acts thereof. Secondly, becauſe there is leſs <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profit</hi> in outward obedience to the <hi>first Table,</hi> as in <hi>hearing, reading, praying, talking of Religion,</hi> urging this or that <hi>way</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> then in the obedience to the <hi>ſecond Table;</hi> by breaking whereof we think we can mend our eſtates well, and yet come off handſomely with the world in the greater practiſe of more <hi>outward holineſs.</hi> And thus our <hi>ſingularity</hi> in outward piety may alſo be of uſe to our <hi>intereſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:115689:39"/>and by a ſtickling in <hi>outward refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> we may raiſe a <hi>duſt</hi> to <hi>blinde</hi> mens eyes ſo far, as they may eaſily think, that while we have <hi>our eyes lifted up to heaven,</hi> we are not like to have an <hi>hand in their pockets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>morality</hi> is much to be regarded by thoſe who bear <hi>the Name of Chriſt</hi> upon them in their general <hi>profeſſion,</hi> becauſe hereby we <hi>adorn</hi> our <hi>Chriſtian calling</hi> moſt; for that ſuch actions do run into the <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ears</hi> of men without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. As for actions of <hi>outward piety,</hi> they are ſubject to debate even amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and therefore more likely are controverted by thoſe who yet are not <hi>Christians:</hi> but theſe actions of <hi>morality</hi> are ſuch, wherein there is no <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> whether good or not, becauſe they come from <hi>common principles.</hi> So that if we have any minde to bring <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> into any <hi>credit</hi> with the <hi>obstinate Jew,</hi> or the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115689:39"/>
                  <hi>blinde Gentile,</hi> we cannot do it with more probability and hope, then if we order our <hi>converſation</hi> ſo, as they may conceive that <hi>Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> hath ſome <hi>truth</hi> in it, becauſe thoſe who are <hi>Diſciples</hi> of it have ſo <hi>good lives.</hi> It hath been ſaid, that <hi>Chriſtianity is more to be ſeen in the leaves of Authors, then in the lives of men:</hi> but thoſe who are <hi>aliens</hi> from the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> do not turn over the <hi>leaves of Writers;</hi> and if they did, yet would ſooner be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> by the <hi>practice of Chriſtians,</hi> were it ſuch as it ſhould be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that denomination. Some would think that the time of the <hi>converſion</hi> of the <hi>Jew</hi> is now near: but it ſeems not to be ſo near by <hi>our converſation.</hi> Therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that others</hi> (which are ſtrangers) <hi>ſeeing your good works may glorifie your Father which is in heaven, Matth.</hi> 5.16. which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115689:40"/>chiefly applyed to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of the Goſpel, but alſo is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ſome proportion to all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> of the Goſpel. Though our perſons are not <hi>juſtified</hi> with <hi>God</hi> by our <hi>works:</hi> yet our <hi>objective faith</hi> is ſurely <hi>juſtified</hi> with <hi>men</hi> by our <hi>good works.</hi> But we are now ſo far from being <hi>juſtified by our good works,</hi> that we cannot <hi>juſtifie our works to be good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>We do not eſteem the faith by the perſon, but we eſteem the perſon by the faith.</hi> It is right, if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> one with another. But <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Jews</hi> would <hi>eſteem</hi> better of our <hi>faith,</hi> if they did ſee or hear in our <hi>perſons</hi> of ſuch actions, as certainly do moſt become <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> not ſimply, but in oppoſition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; becauſe <hi>intemperance</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> do moſt unbecome them. Therefore <hi>let every one that nameth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115689:40"/>the Name of Chriſt depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> as the Apoſtle. But how then cometh it to paſs, that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſhould be ſo careleſs of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor in theſe <hi>morals?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the third queſtion; to which we need not ſay much, that it is ſo. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of it is proved every day: As it was in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, ſo it is now; <hi>The name of God is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed amongſt the Gentiles by you, Rom.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>What is the cauſe hereof? 1. They ſee ſome <hi>Heathens,</hi> or ſome <hi>Civil men,</hi> as they are called, excellent herein, and they think, if they ſhould be very accurate herein, they ſhould carry away no great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſeen more in thoſe actions, which are not ſo common. As ſome have a minde to be <hi>liberal</hi> rather to thoſe who are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to them, then to their <hi>kindred,</hi> becauſe there is not ſo much notice taken of courteſies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115689:41"/>to their <hi>relations,</hi> as to thoſe who can leſs expect it. So if they doe what <hi>Heathens,</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>civil men</hi> do, they conceive they ſhall have no thanks: but if they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and eager, eminent in thoſe things, as of <hi>piety,</hi> which others do ſo little of, then they render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the opinion of the world to be men of high note, and of great name. Yet <hi>(Chriſtians)</hi> if this be your aim to get repute by doing that which is not ſo common, then take heed you forget not <hi>morality,</hi> which is now leſs regarded then, I think, ever. 2. Another thing which is the cauſe of their negligence in <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> is, becauſe it is an <hi>unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble virtue;</hi> and they may loſe by it in this life. As for excellency in <hi>external holineſs,</hi> it cometh natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them for their <hi>advantage:</hi> for hereby the people, who cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, are led on into an opinion of their admirable godlineſs, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115689:41"/>is of uſe to more <hi>reſpect,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> and <hi>trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like thoſe <hi>Silverſmiths</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who pretended their <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> minded their <hi>gain:</hi> ſo do too many of theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> make a <hi>flouriſh</hi> of more religion then ever came from <hi>heaven</hi> or their <hi>hearts,</hi> that there may fall into their lap more of <hi>earth,</hi> which they heartily love.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> from St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> do inform us, that <hi>God</hi> is an <hi>object of fruition</hi> only; and all other things, even <hi>virtues</hi> alſo, are <hi>objects of uſe;</hi> becauſe that only is to be <hi>injoyed,</hi> which we are to <hi>reſt in,</hi> and not to refer to any <hi>higher end;</hi> and that is <hi>God:</hi> but this ſort of men have got a trick to make <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> too, for other <hi>ends,</hi> even ends of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver.</hi> Thus they draw God into their party and ſervice. If it were not for the <hi>firſt Table</hi> ſome men would be undone. They could not tell what ſhift to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115689:42"/>make, if they could not make a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of holineſs</hi> in things of God. Although it be no <hi>duty</hi> of the text to be <hi>rich:</hi> yet they think it will not ſufficiently appear that they are <hi>Gods children,</hi> unleſs he gives them a full <hi>bleſſing</hi> in <hi>great bags,</hi> or <hi>good lands.</hi> This is their real Argument of being <hi>the people of God;</hi> and therefore are they ſo bold as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute with God by more <hi>outward ſanctity</hi> for a <hi>diſpenſation</hi> in point of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> unleſs they take it for granted, that <hi>they are Gods,</hi> and <hi>all is Gods,</hi> and therefore <hi>all is theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatſoever calling they are of, their <hi>ſingular profeſſion</hi> of godlineſs brings in moſt. This fils their purſes. If they did not break the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table,</hi> they could not mend their eſtates, and maintain <hi>ſecond dieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They do not <hi>conſider</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of obedience to God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſecond Table. I dare not ſay they do not <hi>know;</hi> they would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115689:42"/>think I ſhould do them wrong, if I ſhould conceive ſo ill of their abilities: but they do not meditate thereof. For if they did, it were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible, that thoſe who are curious in prying into the <hi>firſt</hi> Table, ſhould be ſo backward to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>ſecond.</hi> If they would perpend that he who wrote the one in ſtone with his own finger wrote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the other, they could not put off the practice of the ſecond, as they do. The reaſon of this obedience we touched before: and therefore we ſhall ſay little.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of connexion of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence intuitive to all is that of the Apoſtle, St. <hi>James,</hi> 2. chap. v. 10. <hi>He that ſhall keep the whole Law, and ſhall offend in one is guilty of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is <hi>guilty of all,</hi> as in reſpect of condemnation: for, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115689:43"/>and it is written <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be meant thus; not that he is guilty of all <hi>diſtributively;</hi> for it is ſuppoſed that he hath kept all the reſt: but <hi>collectively</hi> (as <hi>Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> notes) for that he doth tranſgreſs the law, which is a <hi>collection</hi> of all <hi>precepts;</hi> namely, as the law is one <hi>copulative:</hi> As the whole face is ſaid to be hurt, when but one part is hurt, as <hi>Iſidor Clarius</hi> notes.</p>
               <p>But 3. He is ſaid to be <hi>guilty of all,</hi> becauſe he doth offend againſt him that did <hi>give all;</hi> he violates that abſolute and ſupreme <hi>authority</hi> by which all is eſtabliſhed, and ſo doth by way of interpretation, &amp; in effect, tranſgreſs all; in as much as he doth ſin againſt that <hi>Majeſty,</hi> by which all was equally impoſed. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is agreeable to what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Apoſtle, <hi>For he that ſaid, Thou ſhall not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Thou ſhalt not kil:</hi> and thus every Commandment even of the ſecond
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115689:43"/>Table doth oblige our obedience upon the conſideration of the ſame <hi>Law-maker,</hi> God.</p>
               <p>Had the Laws of the <hi>ſecond Table</hi> been no more then <hi>humane,</hi> had they had no other Majeſty for their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but ſuch as breatheth in the <hi>clay,</hi> we might then have conceived an alleviation of the fault, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with Commandements purely <hi>Divine,</hi> (And yet alſo Humane laws do bind in the virtue of a law Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that we ſhould be obedient to them, the matter being lawful) but ſince all the Precepts which reſpect our neighbor have one and the ſame authority with the reſt, and were informed by the ſame eternal Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wy, we can have no excuſe for our diſobedience, ſpecially if we do withall take notice that God in Scripture hath given us ſuch ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his will, that ſometime he would have us perfer our duty of obedience to thoſe of the <hi>ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115689:44"/>before thoſe of the <hi>firſt Table:</hi> when the matter of the firſt Table is <hi>ceremonial,</hi> and the caſe of the ſecond Table is <hi>neceſſary;</hi> then that word of God takes place, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi> For the laws of the <hi>ſecond Table</hi> are <hi>moral,</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> becauſe they are <hi>good:</hi> the <hi>ceremonials</hi> of the <hi>firſt Table</hi> are <hi>poſitive,</hi> and therefore <hi>good</hi> becauſe <hi>commanded.</hi> Now though in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commandements we are not to look at the matter, but intuitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Author; yet when he gives us a law to prefer the matter, we ſhall not be obedient to the Author, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we do as he biddeth us. And theſe <hi>practical notions</hi> God hath ſo ingraven in our <hi>rational</hi> natures, that they bear as great a relation to our <hi>practical</hi> underſtandings, as <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principles</hi> to the <hi>contemplative.</hi> And therefore they doe remain in man, notwithſtanding the fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nature of man cannot be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115689:44"/>conſerved without them. They are kept in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which is that part of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> wherein are laid up the <hi>rules for action;</hi> that by the <hi>light</hi> of them it may <hi>direct;</hi> and if we do otherwiſe, or not ſo, may <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> and burn.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another cauſe of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> defectiveneſs in the point of <hi>morality</hi> may in part be from <hi>Satan,</hi> who doth ſo much <hi>vie</hi> with God, as we may ſpeak, for obedience and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And therefore he doth mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endevour to diſgrace and ſlurre the profeſſion of Religion by the moſt ſordid and baſe actions of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs</hi> in the Profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo that men may be moved to abhor the practice of piety for the ſakes of thoſe who do moſt abuſe it, becauſe they do but uſe it for better expedition of their iniquities. To this purpoſe the Devil, who is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxive</hi> into the <hi>phanſie,</hi> doth raiſe and ſtir up the dainty imaginations
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115689:45"/>of <hi>felicity</hi> in things temporal; that the <hi>phanſie</hi> kindled may inflame the <hi>affections,</hi> and the <hi>affections</hi> infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med may in an heat and tumult mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny againſt the counſel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to have their ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>For did not the populacy of theſe <hi>affections</hi> interpoſe againſt the dictates of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> in point of <hi>action</hi> no more then they do againſt <hi>reaſon</hi> in point of <hi>aſſent</hi> to principles ſpeculative, we could not be ſo full as we are of evil deeds. But as <hi>evill words cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good manners;</hi> ſo <hi>evil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> by cuſtom, corrupt our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of action. And as no man does forget what naturally hee knows, that the <hi>whole</hi> is greater then the <hi>part,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerveth: ſo neither would we forget our ſelves in any wickedneſs to others, but that love to our ſelves, which the Devil tickleth our <hi>phanſie</hi> with, doth put
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115689:45"/>in againſt the <hi>practice</hi> of what is right, but not commodious for our intereſt.</p>
               <p>Such the account, why <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are no better in their <hi>morals.</hi> But indeed the main cauſe is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and it is this, becauſe they are not <hi>right Christians;</hi> in profeſſion ſuch, and that is all. They are not <hi>real Chriſtians;</hi> they have nothing of <hi>Christ</hi> in them. For if they had, they would not for ſhame of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world be outgone by <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> in any actions which are fit for men. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelled in their hearts, he ſhould dwell there by <hi>Faith;</hi> if by <hi>faith,</hi> that worketh by <hi>love;</hi> if by <hi>love,</hi> it would ſhew it ſelf in keeping <hi>Gods commandements:</hi> and ſo <hi>piety</hi> in the <hi>root</hi> would be <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> in the <hi>fruit.

               <p>Therefore let thy love be as <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> as <hi>man.</hi> There is no man a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to thy nature. And did not he that made thee make him?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115689:57"/>Have we not al <hi>one Father,</hi> as is ſaid? <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that ſhe was indeed his <hi>ſiſter,</hi> for ſhe was the <hi>daughter</hi> of his <hi>father,</hi> though not the <hi>daughter</hi> of his <hi>mother;</hi> although the tearms be taken largely according to the manner of the language: ſo he, whoſoever he is, is thy <hi>brother,</hi> and he is the child of thy <hi>Father, God;</hi> though he be not the childe of thy <hi>Mother, Ieruſalem</hi> which is above, (which is the <hi>Mother of us all,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.)

               <p>But a true real <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is one of the <hi>Admirables</hi> under heaven; Nay, indeed there is none but he. And <hi>declaratively</hi> towards men, all that he is, he is by <hi>charity;</hi> whereby his ſpirit and affection goeth over all the world in an <hi>univerſal diffuſion,</hi> and would do, had it efficacy, good to <hi>all the Earth</hi> at once; but would ſerve thoſe which are <hi>good</hi> in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intention.

               </p>
               <p>As for any exhortations to this virtue, there is no need of any to thoſe who know more delight in it then in any thing elſe.

               </p>
               <p>Thoſe three are the three <hi>Worthies</hi> amongſt the <hi>Theological virtues:</hi> And he that was wrapt up into the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> makes this the <hi>chief of the three,</hi> becauſe this will go up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be perfected there. There is no more ſubſtantial virtue here: for the very <hi>matter</hi> of it is ſubſtantial; beſide the <hi>morality</hi> of the <hi>affection,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirituality</hi> of the <hi>end,</hi> the very <hi>matter</hi> of this object is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto others.

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:115689:59"/> 2. Other virtues, even thoſe two, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> they both draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; <hi>faith</hi> unites to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and <hi>hope</hi> expects to the perſon: but this <hi>charity</hi> as it hath relation to others puts from us, and moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inferior <hi>ſphere</hi> of others. <hi>Faith</hi> takes in into the minde, <hi>hope</hi> looks out for the perſon; but <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> gives out. <hi>Faith</hi> ſees it and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it as exiſtent: <hi>hope</hi> holds out the head to wait for it as coming: but <hi>charity</hi> deals out that which is preſent to the uſe of others. Without <hi>faith</hi> we could have no <hi>hope:</hi> without <hi>hope</hi> we could not ſtay for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the heart would <hi>break:</hi> but without <hi>charity faith</hi> were dead, and <hi>hope</hi> too, and the <hi>poor</hi> could not live, and we ſhould have no <hi>reward.</hi> In the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> none were to appear before the Lord <hi>empty:</hi> at that <hi>great day</hi> none muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord of glory, empty of good works; With <hi>ſuch ſacrifices
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115689:59"/>God is well pleaſed, Heb.</hi> 13.16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to the minde of St. <hi>Paul, Charity is the greater vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the three,</hi> becauſe <hi>charity</hi> is that virtue which ſhall remain in heaven; becauſe that is the <hi>fruitive virtue:</hi> for by mediation of it we are joyned to <hi>God</hi> the chief good in glory. <hi>Love</hi> is an affection of <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> unto the <hi>chief good,</hi> which is the chief object; and according to the <hi>degrees</hi> of the <hi>good</hi> which are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, ſo is the <hi>degree</hi> of this <hi>love;</hi> and therefore the <hi>infinite good</hi> when it is acknowledged, muſt infinitely raviſh. So the Schoolmen, <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the chief good being clearly ſeen, doth raviſh the will. Therefore when in heaven we ſhall clearly <hi>ſee God</hi> to he the chief good, we cannot chuſe but infinitely as we are able <hi>deſire</hi> him, and <hi>delight</hi> in him; for there we ſhal have as much as we can deſire; for it is alwayes preſent. We are as in the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>goodneſs;</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:115689:60"/>and we have as much as we can <hi>take in.</hi> Here we ſee him but confuſely as it were to be the chief good: and the interpoſition of other temporal good things doth hinder our clear ſight of him: yet according as we <hi>ſee</hi> him here, we <hi>love</hi> him here: but as the <hi>light</hi> in heaven ſhall be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo the <hi>love</hi> in heaven ſhall be perfected. <hi>Faith</hi> which is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it imperfect (though ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for its uſe) ſhall ſink into <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Hope</hi> which is alſo imperfect in the nature (though ſufficient for its uſe) that ſhall alſo ſink into <hi>fruition:</hi> thoſe two graces ſhall not be <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in heaven, though they be <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> here; becauſe their <hi>imperfection</hi> is in <hi>nature,</hi> not in <hi>degree,</hi> and therefore their imperfections ſhall not be made up in heaven, but they ſhall ceaſe in their <hi>acts,</hi> which in the <hi>kinde</hi> of them were <hi>imperfect</hi> and accommodated only for this ſtate here below: but <hi>charity</hi> which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115689:60"/>hath alone the capacity of <hi>fruition</hi> proper to it, that ſhall be <hi>perfected</hi> in heaven, which was <hi>imperfect</hi> here; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>imperfection</hi> of it was not in the <hi>nature</hi> of it, but in the <hi>degree.</hi> This virtue Theological in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is diſpoſitive to go into the happineſs of the <hi>chief good.</hi> Here it hath not a full ſight of the chief good, but ſhall have in heaven; then this virtue ſhall be always at ful.</p>
               <p>And therefore he that hath not <hi>charity</hi> here, which in the <hi>flame</hi> of it goeth up to <hi>God,</hi> but with the <hi>heat</hi> of it warmeth thoſe near it; he ſhall not have <hi>glory:</hi> for he hath not that which goes into <hi>glory</hi> by the <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of its <hi>degrees.</hi> He hath not that <hi>grace</hi> which ſhall be made <hi>glory.</hi> Wherefore let not thoſe talk of heaven, which yet have nothing in them towards it. God doth receive into the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> immediately upon his <hi>love</hi> of <hi>complacency,</hi> which reſpects his <hi>children,</hi> as being <hi>like</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:115689:61"/>him in goodneſs. He cannot delight in for ever thoſe who have not here ſome likeneſs to him; and in what but <hi>charity?</hi> For <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to God; becauſe they are <hi>imperfect</hi> in their kinde. So then if we will not be <hi>charitable,</hi> we muſt be <hi>miſerable.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>prayer</hi> is an act of high wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which belongs to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> to him we ſhould go in our prayers; and by <hi>Chriſt</hi> we ſhould: we have warrant for this.</p>
               <p>And in the frequency of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion doth <hi>goodneſs</hi> appear, as we take it in the latitude. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> ſtrictly hath in it a reſpect to <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication:</hi> but yet as it hath ſome reſpect to <hi>grace,</hi> ſo it alſo attendeth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115689:64"/>the means of reception. And if we cannot give well without <hi>charity;</hi> and cannot have <hi>charity</hi> but from <hi>God;</hi> and cannot have it from <hi>God</hi> but by <hi>prayer;</hi> then <hi>goodneſs</hi> will be exerciſed in <hi>prayer</hi> to God, that he would be good to us, in giving us that <hi>grace,</hi> which moſt properly doth denominate us <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Heathen could ſee that we are not <hi>good</hi> by <hi>outward goods;</hi> and therefore if one hath a <hi>better eſtate,</hi> he is not the <hi>better man,</hi> but <hi>hath</hi> the <hi>better eſtate;</hi> ſo if he hath the better horſe, he is not the better man, but hath the better horſe; if he hath better clothes, he is not the better man yet, but hath the better clothes.</p>
               <p>But neither are we ſaid <hi>formally</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope;</hi> becauſe the acts of thoſe habits are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>towards us;</hi> but the actions of <hi>charity</hi> are terminated <hi>from us;</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>God,</hi> or our <hi>neighbor</hi> for God.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould we not then uſe this

How can we do better then in asking that gift from God, whereby we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>do good?</hi> Not that we ſhould begge this only; (for it will not go alone) but becauſe unleſs we <hi>beg</hi> it of <hi>God,</hi> we ſhall not have it; and unleſs we have it, thoſe that <hi>begge</hi> of us are like to go without; and we ſhall do no good in the world.

                  </gap>, that conferreth nothing to the publique.</p>
               <p>Indeed we have other virtues to ſolicit the Throne of grace for. There is <hi>faith</hi> the prime virtue, as being the <hi>root</hi> of other <hi>virtues,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any thing in us towards ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and layeth hold on <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> There is <hi>hope,</hi> the <hi>Anchor</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> amidſt all the <hi>ſtorms</hi> of afflictions. There is <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> which is in <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> when we are in <hi>proſperity;</hi> there is <hi>patience,</hi> which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115689:65"/>is proper, when we are low and in <hi>adverſity:</hi> there is <hi>meekneſs,</hi> when we are <hi>inraged</hi> or <hi>provoked.</hi> But <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is all, or ſuppoſeth all.

               <p>Therefore if thou wilt <hi>de</hi> any thing, <hi>pray:</hi> and if thou wilt <hi>pray</hi> for any thing, pray for <hi>charity;</hi> which hath relation to all the world; <hi>God, Neighbors, Enemies, Infidels;</hi> all.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115689:65"/>for <hi>mortification,</hi> ſo little for the <hi>world:</hi> and therefore that petition for <hi>daily bread</hi> they underſtood of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>Sacramental</hi> bread. As if they only had underſtood and practiſed that precept of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all theſe things ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto you;</hi> in way of <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus.</hi> But then by this account this grace of <hi>charity</hi> is moſt to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for this is it which throwes about here and there theſe temporal things; this is it, without which the <hi>poor</hi> cannot live. Although the <hi>begging poor</hi> are not wont to have any <hi>virtue:</hi> yet they live by a <hi>virtue</hi> in <hi>others,</hi> and that is <hi>charity.</hi> That which is not neceſſarily connexed with our happineſs, we refer to Gods infinite wiſdom, and ſo ſave our ſelves the care of it; but that which no man can <hi>uſe ill,</hi> (as a <hi>principle</hi>) that which God worketh <hi>in us,</hi> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115689:66"/>
                  <hi>without us;</hi> that which is it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we <hi>live well,</hi> (as he deſcribeth <hi>virtue</hi>) that we muſt <hi>deſire;</hi> and that if any other, is <hi>charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for our incouragement, if we requeſt <hi>ſpirituals,</hi> we make an argument not to be denyed; becauſe they are ſuch; and ſuch as do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Evangelical promiſes;</hi> which like <hi>election,</hi> are <hi>abſolute;</hi> yet not without <hi>means;</hi> and therefore we muſt <hi>pray</hi> for them. In things <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> we may loſe our <hi>hope:</hi> but in things <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> we cannot; if we do not loſe our <hi>hold.</hi> So then, let us never give over <hi>prayer,</hi> let us <hi>pray continually,</hi> as the Apoſtle bids us: not as if we ought never to leave off the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> as ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conceived; but never leave off the <hi>duty;</hi> and continually in regard of <hi>ſeaſons</hi> and <hi>need.</hi> And therefore <hi>how often</hi> we ſhould <hi>pray,</hi> who can tell? for who can tell how often we ſhall have occaſion? <hi>At evening,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115689:66"/>and in the morning, and at noon-day will I pray and make a noiſe, and he ſhall hear my voice, Pſal.</hi> 55.17. In the <hi>beginning,</hi> and in the <hi>middle,</hi> and in the <hi>end</hi> of the day <hi>prayer</hi> hath its ſeaſon; for it is the <hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>progreſs,</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; though not <hi>ultimately;</hi> yet <hi>diſpoſitively.</hi> For this way he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth,</hi> he <hi>continueth,</hi> he is <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> in <hi>goodneſs,</hi> becauſe thus he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth what God diſpenſeth. For <hi>prayer</hi> is directed to <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> noted, not as to <hi>change</hi> Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but to obtain, what he hath by his <hi>Providence</hi> diſpoſed for us.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>good action</hi> were all <hi>good men</hi> converſant! Surely in this ſome <hi>hypocrites</hi> are much: but without it was never any which was real. It is not therefore a <hi>trial</hi> of our <hi>goodneſs,</hi> but a <hi>neceſſary condition.</hi> It is not a <hi>diſtinctive property,</hi> but a <hi>certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient.</hi> He that uſeth it may be bad, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, who

               </p>
               <p>So it is more eaſie to diſcern the <hi>negative;</hi> he is not <hi>good,</hi> becauſe he doth not <hi>pray;</hi> then the <hi>affirmative;</hi> he doth <hi>pray,</hi> therefore he is <hi>good;</hi> For the act may be done in <hi>hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:</hi> and that is worſt of all. Indeed <hi>inward acts</hi> of <hi>duty,</hi> or <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>inward duties</hi> are good arguments that we are <hi>good;</hi> as if we <hi>love</hi> God, <hi>fear</hi> God, <hi>rejoyce</hi> in God, <hi>hope</hi> in God: but <hi>outward acts</hi> are not, as ſuch; as outward; becauſe they may be done extrinſecally for the end. <hi>God</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>Adverbs,</hi> as he ſaid, becauſe they reſpect the <hi>internal act</hi> of the performance, and have relation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the <hi>form,</hi> not the <hi>matter</hi> of the action.</p>
               <p>Yet let not the <hi>hypocrite</hi> make thee an <hi>Atheiſt:</hi> as if becauſe he doth not <hi>pray</hi> but for <hi>ſecular ends;</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115689:67"/>therefore thou ſhouldſt not <hi>pray at all.</hi> Do that which he doth, but do it not as he doth it. Pray bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and pray that he may pray better.</p>

                  <hi>Tears</hi> with <hi>prayers</hi> do excellently; they make our <hi>prayers</hi> more fluent, and our <hi>voice</hi> more liquid, and more acceptable to heaven. The very Heathen gave his good word of <hi>mourning men,</hi> that they are <hi>good men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God gave us <hi>tears</hi> only for <hi>ſin,</hi> ſaith the Father homiletically, St. <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi> yet we may alſo with them lament the ſad conditions of others.</p>
               <p>Surely that which we ſhould mainly ſpend theſe <hi>ſuperfluities</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the <hi>ſuperfluity of naughtineſs</hi> (which is not to be underſtood <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctively</hi> of ſome ſins, but <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> of all:) but yet we may <hi>weep</hi> for the <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi> upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <p>It is very ſtrange to prove the <hi>cauſe</hi> after the <hi>victory;</hi> and not to know what we fight for, untill we have done.

And yet how much greater diſproportion, if thou doſt not ſhed tears! What have we to do here now in this <hi>valley</hi> of <hi>tears</hi> but to <hi>weep?</hi> Open the <hi>floud-gates;</hi> and let them pour out.

               </p>
               <p>But why ſhould we <hi>mourn</hi> for our <hi>ſins,</hi> ſince they are <hi>pardoned,</hi> Yes; Oh more.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115689:72"/>after ſuch provocations. Nothing is, in effect, ſo <hi>coactive,</hi> as <hi>love;</hi> nor formally leſs, becauſe it makes us ſo <hi>willing.

I <hi>am aſhamed to be ſo often pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as he he ſaid to a gratious Prince, whom he had been diſloyal often to; as if in abhorrence of his iniquities he would have a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more able to bear it, then the weight of the courteſie, <hi>clemency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O my Saviour, ſince thou haſt been pleaſed to <hi>wiſh</hi> my <hi>ſoul</hi> in thy <hi>bloud,</hi> let me alſo <hi>waſh</hi> it in my <hi>tears;</hi> not to make it <hi>whiter,</hi> but becauſe it hath been ſo <hi>foul:</hi> not to adde to <hi>thy righteouſneſs</hi> (for what can be added to that which is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> by me who am <hi>nothing?</hi>) but to <hi>do juſtice</hi> upon <hi>my ſelf</hi> for all my ſins, which have put thee to all this trouble for me.</p>
               <p>But how ſoon ſhall we want <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for the bewailing of <hi>one ſin?</hi>

               <p>O make my <hi>ſorrow</hi> more, that I may have more <hi>joy;</hi> for now, in this condition of ſinners, there is left us no <hi>joy</hi> but after <hi>ſorrow,</hi> or out of it.

               <p>Bleſſed Saviour, who didſt bid thy ſervant St. <hi>Peter</hi> to come to thee upon the water, help me to come to thee upon this <hi>water</hi> of <hi>repentance:</hi> and ſtretch out thy <hi>hand</hi> leſt I <hi>ſink;</hi> yea alſo ſince my <hi>tears</hi> are not <hi>clean,</hi> but have earth and filth in them, and therefore they need tears, and thoſe tears other tears, and ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity; therefore do thou <hi>waſh</hi> even my <hi>tears</hi> alſo in the pure <hi>fountain</hi> of thy moſt pretious <hi>bloud;</hi> leſt I go into ſuch <hi>ſorrow</hi> as <hi>ſhould be,</hi> becauſe

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115689:80"/>Heathen Poets feigned <hi>ſeveral gods</hi> to be favourable to <hi>ſeveral Nations:</hi> we have the boldneſs to make the <hi>one</hi> true <hi>God</hi> to be favourable to <hi>divers ways.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> is God divided?

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115689:81"/>guilty of their errours and their evil practices, that we may no more ſpeak againſt <hi>them,</hi> leſt we ſpeak againſt <hi>our ſelves?</hi> So they have made us their <hi>fools,</hi> to <hi>laugh at us:</hi> and yet (which is the greateſt folly) <hi>we</hi> muſt <hi>laugh</hi> too; or elſe we are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as thoſe who are <hi>diſaffected; ill affected.</hi> O tyranny over the mindes of men! which, he that <hi>likes</hi> it, doth very well <hi>deſerve.</hi> And when <hi>liberty,</hi> which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, cometh, his <hi>fault</hi> and his <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> ſhould be together, to be a <hi>ſervant</hi> of <hi>corruption.</hi> And if he be of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> he ſhould be ſerved right, if he were <hi>degraded,</hi> for his <hi>degradation</hi> of it.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:115689:83"/> 1. <hi>How;</hi> This our Saviour gave warning of, <hi>Take heed how ye hear, Luk.</hi> 8.18. St. <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi> The thing is to be regarded in the <hi>manner.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> loves <hi>Adverbs,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notate the <hi>act,</hi> but expreſs the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> from whence the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather cometh, becauſe the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> doth proceed from the <hi>diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>minde;</hi> the <hi>act outward</hi> may be for <hi>outward ends:</hi> The <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>hearing</hi> hath relation to the <hi>Word,</hi> to the <hi>Soul,</hi> and to <hi>God.</hi> To the <hi>Word;</hi> and it is to be heard in <hi>love</hi> to it. To the <hi>Soul;</hi> and it is to be heard with a <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi> To <hi>God</hi> three ways; as <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it to be <hi>mean</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual good.</hi> 2. To <hi>God</hi> as <hi>ſpeaking</hi> by <hi>man.</hi> 3. To <hi>God</hi> as <hi>bleſſing</hi> it. As he <hi>ordaineth</hi> it; ſo we ought to have a great regard of it. He that rejecteth <hi>Ordinances,</hi> doth contemn <hi>God,</hi> and doth contrary to what he ſhould
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115689:83"/>pray for, that the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may be <hi>hallowed.</hi> Then he muſt reſpect <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>bleſſing</hi> it; therefore he muſt uſe <hi>prayer</hi> to him, that he would vouchſafe his grace, ſo as the <hi>Word</hi> may come into the <hi>heart;</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> may be turned by practice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>work.</hi> But alſo he muſt attend <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>ſpeaking</hi> by the <hi>Miniſter:</hi> for elſe he attendeth but to the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>man.</hi> For the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> makes it not to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> becauſe that <hi>authority</hi> may be impreſſed upon other <hi>Ordinances:</hi> but that which maketh it to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is becauſe <hi>God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> by <hi>man;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were commended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>they received the Word, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of God,</hi> 1 Epiſtle, 2.13. And this makes it diſtinctively <hi>Gods houſe,</hi> becauſe God ſpeaketh there. The <hi>Commiſſion</hi> which he hath given to men to ſpeak there, maketh
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115689:84"/>it to be an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould preach there; but it is <hi>his ſpeaking</hi> by them, which maketh it as the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is ſpoken; ſo the place the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> where it is ſpoken: The <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is upon <hi>Judicature</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and yet the place is not called the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It is called the <hi>Kings Court,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaketh there: it is not called <hi>Gods Court;</hi> becauſe he doth not ſpeak immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately there, as he doth in the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this were duly regarded that <hi>God ſpeaketh</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> this would remedy a great many enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; namely, <hi>irreverence</hi> in the place and ſervice. Is any one <hi>cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in <hi>heaven?</hi> This would cure the <hi>itching ear;</hi> the <hi>curious eye;</hi> the <hi>wandering thought;</hi> the <hi>critical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> and the <hi>defects</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> which by it are either to be <hi>corrected,</hi> if <hi>peccant;</hi> or <hi>ſupplyed,</hi> if <hi>wanting.</hi>

               <p> The daintineſs of theſe times will not endure to <hi>hear</hi> ſome <hi>Miniſters:</hi> which by way of interpretation is as much as if they went to <hi>hear men.</hi> If they go to <hi>hear God,</hi> they will minde his <hi>word</hi> by any <hi>meſſenger,</hi> any <hi>Embaſſadour;</hi> for he repreſents his <hi>Maſter.</hi> If the <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> be mean, we ſhew the more reſpect to him that <hi>ſent</hi> him. The ground of what we ſay, is in the Word of <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is <hi>God.</hi> We have it in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me.</hi> He ſpake it of the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> whom he ſent out <hi>by couples,</hi> by two. I pray God we have <hi>one</hi> left. And he ſaith to them all diſtributively, <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, heareth me;</hi> not he that heareth ſuch a pair, or ſuch a pair, or one of the two; but of every cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of every one, <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, heareth me.</hi> But ſome we are not for; No? Is there any difference in <hi>God?</hi> He that hath a minde on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſome <hi>man,</hi> hath no heart to <hi>God.</hi>

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:115689:85"/>
               <p> Was that leſs then a blaſphemy in him of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely devoted to <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſaid, <hi>If</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Calvin <hi>were to preach at the ſame time, he would leave</hi> Paul <hi>to hear</hi> Calvin? For he did not only prefer <hi>Calvin</hi> to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but in a manner he did prefer <hi>Calvin</hi> before <hi>God;</hi> as if he would not hear <hi>God,</hi> unleſs he would ſpeak by <hi>Calvin?</hi> Unleſs he would ſend by the hand of <hi>Calvin,</hi> he would not receive his <hi>meſſage.</hi> This is no other then moſt errant peeviſhneſs, to give audience to none but thoſe who are directed how to pleaſe us.</p>
               <p>This <hi>bad humor</hi> is to be <hi>diſcuſſed;</hi> for it is like to <hi>breed.</hi> Nay I ſpeak too late; it hath bred <hi>ſchiſms</hi> and <hi>hereſies.</hi> Had we <hi>good ſtomachs,</hi> or any reſpect to the <hi>Founder,</hi> we would not nauſcate <hi>good meat,</hi> which God ſendeth us, becauſe it is not <hi>ſerved up</hi> in our <hi>faſhion,</hi> or be not <hi>dreſſed</hi> in our way, and to our <hi>palat.</hi> And
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115689:85"/>muſt <hi>God</hi> ſpeak in an <hi>affected tone;</hi> or elſe we will not be <hi>affected?</hi> If thou doſt not like the <hi>Miniſter;</hi> what, not <hi>God</hi> neither? Thus thou deſpiſeſt him who might prove, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, thy <hi>ſpiritual Father.</hi> And ſomewhat to this purpoſe hath been told me by a party, who, when one came up into the Pulpit that ſeemed not to be able to ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe, deſpiſed him at heart: but before he had done, ſhe had done deſpiſing him; and afterwards high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed him.</p>
               <p>Take heed leſt this <hi>luxury</hi> of the <hi>ear</hi> coſt thee not a remedy by <hi>Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, becauſe we do not <hi>like</hi> it but by whom we <hi>like;</hi> and leſt we be not worthily puniſhed by thoſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>long pleaſe</hi> us, for our diſreſpect to thoſe <hi>Ministers,</hi> who had much <hi>worth,</hi> but none of our <hi>irregular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, if thou findeſt a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:115689:86"/>do not ſtand upon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>perſon,</hi> or <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>texts</hi> or <hi>expreſſions:</hi> but be ready to <hi>hear</hi> what the <hi>Lord</hi> will <hi>ſpeak</hi> by him He that hath a deſire to chuſe his <hi>Embaſſadour,</hi> is to be ſuſpected that he hath a minde to chuſe the <hi>meſſage</hi> too. Take heed, unleſs thou canſt <hi>chuſe,</hi> whether thou wouldſt be <hi>ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>when</hi> muſt we hear? when others may preach; in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon; <hi>Be inſtant,</hi> or <hi>inſist</hi> in it, or <hi>urge the word in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. which, by ſome, is to be underſtood <hi>proverbially,</hi> that he ſhould never give over this work: or may be underſtood <hi>disjunctively,</hi> as <hi>Iſid. Clarius</hi> notes; namely thus, <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> if it may be; if not for ſuch a buſineſs, <hi>out of ſeaſon.</hi> To be ſure, the command intends <hi>frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Preaching;</hi> and conſequently <hi>frequency of hearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet <hi>diligence</hi> in mens <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115689:86"/>calling</hi> is to be conſidered, as ſuch a <hi>duty;</hi> that if we be not able conveniently to be at Church on the <hi>week day</hi> in regard of trade and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, we may conclude it not fit to leave the particular calling upon that account. And the reaſon is, becauſe, if the <hi>fourth Commandement</hi> be <hi>moral,</hi> (as they account it) we are under a Commandement of <hi>working ſix days:</hi> but we are not under a Commandement of <hi>hearing</hi> ſo often as there be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the <hi>week day;</hi> and therefore that which is <hi>negative,</hi> cannot preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that which is <hi>poſitive.</hi> And if there were a command for it, yet it were reducible unto a <hi>ceremonial law,</hi> which gives way to <hi>morals,</hi> in a competition; according to the rule, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> And therefore even upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid, it was <hi>lawful to do good,</hi> to <hi>heal;</hi> and ſo to <hi>ſhew mercy.</hi> And we doubt it not to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115689:87"/>be a duty, even in time of publique Service, to leave the Church, to quench a fire, or to be helpful to any in a neceſſity. If thou beeſt therefore a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as thou wouldſt be reckoned by the love of the <hi>Word,</hi> remember to <hi>provide for thy family,</hi> leſt thou <hi>deny the faith,</hi> and be <hi>worſe then an Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third queſtion ſomewhat is to be ſaid, beſides what hath been ſaid. We touched formerly the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>hearing Miniſters,</hi> as they were compared with <hi>Miniſters.</hi> And we thought it not arbitrary to us, whether we will hear thoſe which are appointed to us, although they are not ſo excellent as others: but now we compare <hi>Miniſters</hi> with thoſe who are by a very long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription (even from <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s time) called <hi>Laiques,</hi> or <hi>Lay-men:</hi> and the queſtion is, <hi>whether we ſhould hear Lay-men preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>question</hi> of the <hi>ſeaſon:</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:115689:87"/>but this is not neceſſary for me to determin. It is enough here, that it is <hi>no queſtion</hi> whether we ſhould <hi>hear Miniſters,</hi> I think alſo by their own confeſſion: then if others were wiſe to make ſure of their duty, they would hear <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and not <hi>them;</hi> becauſe there is <hi>no doubt</hi> of the one, but there is as <hi>great doubt</hi> of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or, if you will, let it be <hi>out of doubt;</hi> in the negative.</p>
               <p>State the caſe, and take it. That it is no act of piety for any of the people to hear them, is plain upon their own <hi>principles,</hi> at leaſt moſt of them who are moſt ſober: becauſe they ſay they do not <hi>preach authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively;</hi> and if not <hi>authoritatively,</hi> then not by any <hi>command.</hi> If not by any <hi>command,</hi> then it is no act of <hi>piety</hi> for them to <hi>preach:</hi> or if it be an act of <hi>piety</hi> without any <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> then it is a <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> which they ſo much impute to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But then the queſtion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115689:88"/>will be, <hi>whether it be lawful to hear them.</hi> This may be alſo reſolved by their own <hi>axiomes;</hi> for if they ſay that nothing is to be done in the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (which is their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt the <hi>Ceremonies</hi>) without his <hi>command,</hi> then this alſo is not to be done upon the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe they are not <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> it, but they do it as an action of a <hi>free ſpirit;</hi> and not of <hi>ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but <hi>perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is but a perſtriction of the irregular practiſe of thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to <hi>preach</hi> before they know the <hi>text;</hi> and therefore are not like to underſtand what they ſay of what. Our Saviour in the <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi> Is it fit that thoſe ſhould preach the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> who have not once read the <hi>Alphabet?</hi> and know not one letter of <hi>Greek,</hi> from the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>laſt?</hi> If they <hi>preach</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> then let them <hi>ſpeak languages</hi> as the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115689:88"/>
                  <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and if they <hi>prophecy</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>revelation,</hi> not <hi>gifts.</hi> If he pretends <hi>revelation;</hi> let him go to thoſe who do not acknowledg the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and confirm the truth of his <hi>revelation</hi> by <hi>miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſhort; he whom thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to <hi>hear,</hi> being not a <hi>Mìniſter,</hi> is either <hi>ignorant,</hi> or not. If he be <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;</hi> why doſt thou <hi>hear</hi> him? If he be <hi>not ignorant,</hi> but ſpeaks as a <hi>Clerk;</hi> ſuſpect him not to be a private man that follows <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but a private one that followeth <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Such come up under the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lay-men</hi> to undermine the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> This the people will not <hi>ſee,</hi> leſt they ſhould <hi>ſee</hi> their <hi>infelicity</hi> at the beſt of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helpers hereunto. Leſt they ſhould ſeem to <hi>have been deceived,</hi> they <hi>will be deceived</hi> further. So at the end, we may fear the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that former ſaying, <hi>If

                  <hi>MEditation</hi> is, in general, of great uſe. And we ſhould firſt meditate of the uſe of it. There be three things, as is obſerved, which make a good <hi>Scholar; reading, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, meditation. Reading</hi> (parts
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115689:91"/>being ſuppoſed) makes a <hi>full</hi> ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>Conference,</hi> a <hi>ready</hi> ſcholar. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> makes a <hi>deep</hi> ſcholar. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in ſome proportion, <hi>Meditation</hi> makes a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ſolid Chriſtian; Reading</hi> makes him know what is the <hi>letter</hi> of <hi>Gods will. Conference</hi> with others may help him to know the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> and to apply it to <hi>caſes. Meditation</hi> works all into the minde, and <hi>roots</hi> it in for <hi>uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> at large hath many objects. It may have reference to <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Eſsence:</hi> but this exceeds the minde of man. In an <hi>Infinite beeing</hi> there is nothing to terminate the <hi>Intellect;</hi> becauſe it is <hi>infinite.</hi> It may have reference to <hi>God;</hi> as <hi>One</hi> ſingular <hi>Eſsènce</hi> is communicated to <hi>three Perſons,</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> But this doth more ſwallow up our <hi>contemplation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth more tranſcend <hi>reaſon.</hi> For if the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>reaſon,</hi> which are not negative to the beeing of a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115689:91"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> ſhould alſo clearly extend to the diſcerning of one excluſively; they would be more puzled at this, how that <hi>one Divine Eſſence</hi> ſhould be communicated to <hi>three,</hi> and yet there ſhould be but <hi>one.</hi> And therefore ſaith the Father, <hi>When I think upon one, there comes into my minde three: and when I think upon three, there comes into my minde one.</hi> And therefore this myſterie is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>admired</hi> then <hi>meditated:</hi> becauſe the conceits thereof, ſuch as we can make, are not to be expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, but ſquared and fixed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch apprehenſions thereof as we have in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But meditate we may and ought of <hi>God</hi> in regard of his <hi>effects;</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and in <hi>Providence.</hi> For his <hi>effects</hi> in <hi>Nature</hi> do give us occaſion to praiſe his excellent <hi>Attributes;</hi> his <hi>wiſdom</hi> in the <hi>beauty</hi> of them; his <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of them; his <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115689:92"/>them, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> meditated in his Book upon the <hi>ſix days work.</hi> And reaſonably is it thought that one of the chief ends of the <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>ſeventh Day</hi> to the <hi>Jew</hi> for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was this, that man might be at leiſure that day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the <hi>creation,</hi> and to give God the honour thereof; of all; great, and alſo of thoſe which are not great, in quantity: for <hi>God</hi> is <hi>magnus in minimïs,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>great in that which is leaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we have cauſe to meditate of him in his <hi>providence</hi> towards that which he hath <hi>created,</hi> and doth <hi>ſuſtain</hi> every moment by the word of his power; His <hi>Providence</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil;</hi> namely, the good or evil of <hi>condition.</hi> By the former he engageth us to <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> by the latter to <hi>repentance:</hi> And this <hi>affliction</hi> we have need of. It is St. <hi>Peters</hi> expreſſion in his 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, 1.6. <hi>Though now (if need
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115689:92"/>be) you are afflicted with divers tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</hi> It is as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to us as our <hi>day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food:</hi> nay more. We may live for ever without that <hi>food:</hi> but it may be we ſhould not live for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this <hi>adverſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a meditation of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe we are now ſo full of <hi>puniſhment;</hi> and ſurely we have the more, and are like to have the more, becauſe we have not thought, as we ſhould have done, of this: as in <hi>Ieremies</hi> time the <hi>Iews,</hi> ſo we now, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6. <hi>No man ſpake ought; no man repented him of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaying, What have I done? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one turned to their own race, as the horſe ruſheth into the battail.</hi> How many have how much complained that they are <hi>undone, undone!</hi> but how few have at all complained of what they have <hi>done!</hi> We would have our <hi>Fathers bleſſing,</hi> but will not be brought upon our <hi>knees.</hi> And we would have the <hi>rod</hi> removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115689:93"/>it be <hi>kiſſed.</hi> Not that we ought to approve what <hi>man</hi> hath done; but what <hi>God</hi> hath done; to quicken us in our obedience to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is well ſaid, <hi>That which man doth fooliſhly, God doth wiſely.</hi> We ſhould ſubmit in <hi>patience,</hi> to his <hi>correction;</hi> but we are to follow his <hi>will revealed,</hi> in our <hi>obedience.</hi> By diſpenſations of <hi>providence</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth us <hi>trials,</hi> whereby we are proved, whether, when a <hi>croſs</hi> lies in the way of <hi>duty,</hi> we will leave the plain way, that we may decline the <hi>croſs.</hi> Oh that we had as great a diſaffection to <hi>ſinning,</hi> as to <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</hi> And yet which is <hi>more evil,</hi> or indeed which is <hi>evil,</hi> but that of <hi>fault?</hi> Oh that that which firſt <hi>moved</hi> God to <hi>puniſh,</hi> were firſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved!</hi> Oh that <hi>ſin could</hi> not be done, becauſe it <hi>ſhould</hi> not!</p>
               <p>Such meditations we might goe further in, were there not four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which, becauſe they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115689:93"/>are <hi>laſt (quatuor noviſſima,</hi> as they are called) ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> thought upon, <hi>heaven, hel, death, judgment.</hi> Canſt thou believe there is an <hi>heaven,</hi> and not think upon it? Canſt thou look up to <hi>Heaven;</hi> and not conſider the place of <hi>happineſs?</hi> Is thy <hi>treaſure</hi> there, and not thy <hi>heart?</hi> Or is thy <hi>heart</hi> there, and not thy <hi>thoughts?</hi> or are thy <hi>thoughts</hi> there; and yet inordinately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>world?</hi> Impoſſible. Why ſhould we not have a deſire of as <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoughts</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> as there are <hi>ſtars;</hi> and every thought greater then theſe <hi>ſublunaries?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtian, where is thy minde?

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:115689:94"/>for.

               <p>And whatſoever is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with thy <hi>end,</hi> thou doſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>deſire</hi> in order thereunto; for, <hi>where one is for one, there is but one;</hi> as the rule is. And what can be more influxive, nay intrinſecal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy <hi>happineſs,</hi> then the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with ſuch <hi>injoyment,</hi> as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>expreſſed here,</hi> ſince it cannot be <hi>comprehended there,</hi> as it is, but as we are able. There is no <hi>more</hi> to be ſaid of it; becauſe never <hi>enough.</hi> Here, on earth, how much pleaſure is there in the converſe, though ſhort, with one <hi>real Chriſtian?</hi> There <hi>God;</hi> there our Head <hi>Chriſt;</hi> there the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> there <hi>Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;</hi> there <hi>Saints glorified:</hi> and for ever.</p>

               <p>No man can <hi>deſire</hi> to be <hi>miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> becauſe it is contrary to his <hi>will.</hi> And if any could be ſo fond as to wiſh it, it would be upon a <hi>phanſy</hi> of pleaſing himſelf in a wilde conceit of <hi>happineſs</hi> by that which is <hi>miſery.</hi> Whether it be better <hi>not to have been</hi> then <hi>to be in miſery,</hi> is made a queſtion: but to be ſure, <hi>to be in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is not far from <hi>not being;</hi> becauſe every one that <hi>is</hi> would not be <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> And what <hi>miſery</hi> is that like to be which is by <hi>God</hi> prepared for thoſe who would not let him have the <hi>honour</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> them by his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</hi> What vexation is like to come

               <p>There is no ſuch <hi>anſwer</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi>

               <p>There is another <hi>voice without</hi> thee; the voice of the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who is to <hi>lift up his voice like a trumpet</hi> (as the Prophet was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) to tell thee of thy <hi>ſins,</hi> and what thou muſt expect, when the <hi>judge</hi> cometh, if thou doeſt not mende.

               <p>I have been moved to think upon this caſe, and it doth ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me.</p>
               <p>Therefore firſt <hi>Negatively;</hi> where unto we ſhall premiſe ſome <hi>cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary concluſions,</hi> to avoid miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do not ſay that there is <hi>no goodneſs</hi> in any of thoſe who

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Divine laws</hi> require <hi>intuitive ebedience,</hi> as coming from <hi>God,</hi> who hath <hi>authority abſolutely ſupreme;</hi> and cannot <hi>command</hi> any thing <hi>bad.

               <p>
                  <hi>Affirmatively</hi> now, there is a <hi>goodneſs</hi> belonging to <hi>humane obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> in the right ſtate of it, firſt if there be <hi>authority</hi> in him that <hi>makes</hi> the <hi>Law.</hi> External <hi>power</hi> doth not <hi>morally</hi> ground <hi>obedience,</hi> which hath relation to <hi>due authority.</hi> 2. For the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> it muſt not be contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe no man can be bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> in his <hi>authority,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> in his <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi> 3.

So that the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115689:108"/>principal <hi>object</hi> in this <hi>obedience</hi> to man, is <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under theſe <hi>conditions</hi> of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to <hi>man,</hi> what ſhould hinder, but that this <hi>obedience</hi> ſhould be part of our <hi>goodneſs,</hi> which we have now ſo great reaſon to commend?

               </p>
               <p>And therefore if there be any <hi>goodneſs</hi> in <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>precepts</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then there muſt be <hi>goodneſs, pro parte,</hi> in this <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>humane laws.</hi> And if thoſe ſins are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and <hi>waſting</hi> the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> (as Divines ſay) which have in them moſt dangerous conſequences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>vaſtation</hi> of <hi>Societies;</hi> then
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115689:108"/>what ſhould be thought of thoſe men that deny all duty of <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> and make it to be a <hi>duty</hi> to be <hi>diſobedient?</hi> In <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.6. it is ſaid, <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but every one did that which was good in his own eyes.</hi> Whereby it is inferred that when there was a <hi>King,</hi> they did what was <hi>appointed;</hi> and the want of a <hi>King</hi> then, is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be the cauſe of <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> which might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by him.</p>
               <p>Indeed if after the <hi>lawful command</hi> of a <hi>lawful Magiſtrate</hi> it were <hi>free</hi> for us to do what we <hi>pleaſed,</hi> then not only would there not be any <hi>virtue</hi> in <hi>obedience,</hi> but alſo there would not be the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.

               </p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Calvin,</hi> who had the hap to mould Religion in way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>Romane tyranny,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes all <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>conſcience</hi> by <hi>humane laws,</hi> as being contrary to <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> in his third Book of <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> the 19. chapter. <hi>Only to avoid ſcandal,</hi> he ſays, <hi>we ought to abſtain from the uſe of our liberty, in charity to a weak brother.</hi> This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his many embrace; only they adde, that <hi>humane laws do alſo binde againſt contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to any that differ, me thinks this muſt not ſerve. If they <hi>binde</hi> only in theſe caſes, what will become of <hi>humane laws?</hi> To what purpoſe are thoſe <hi>Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>men?</hi> Will not every one ſay, though they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>obedience,</hi> they do not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:115689:109"/>the <hi>authority?</hi> And yet indeed ſome have cruelly <hi>contemned</hi> it. So that they have not ſtood to their own principles herein. And that binding againſt <hi>contempt</hi> reſpects <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> in things <hi>unlawful.</hi> Is there no more reſpect to be given to <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> in things <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if they <hi>binde,</hi> beſides this, only in caſe of <hi>ſcandal;</hi> then firſt, put caſe one thinks in his conſcience he is <hi>bound</hi> in <hi>conſcience</hi> to be <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;</hi> is he in an <hi>error,</hi> or not? If he be not; why are not they of the ſame mind? If he be in an error; what will they do towards him? If they do not <hi>obey,</hi> they <hi>offend</hi> him: if they do <hi>obey,</hi> they <hi>harden</hi> him in his <hi>error.</hi> 2. If they binde only in caſe of <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> beſides the other caſe before; then even after <hi>impoſition</hi> of them by <hi>lawful authority,</hi> they are yet in the ſtate and condition of things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:</hi> for even in theſe things
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115689:110"/>
                  <hi>charity</hi> bindes againſt the uſe of <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> in point of <hi>ſcandal.</hi> And ſo we ſhall make nothing of <hi>authority,</hi> and ſo we ſhall diſanul the <hi>Ordinance</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> 3. Whenſoever they do not <hi>obey,</hi> they give <hi>ſcandal</hi> to ſome or other; therefore as towards <hi>practice</hi> they ſhould always obey. 4. Had they the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in their hands, would they be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented</hi> with ſuch <hi>obedience?</hi> No, they would not be <hi>contented:</hi> but would have the world know, that their <hi>laws</hi> are the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and whoſoever is not <hi>obedient</hi> is a rebel to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore though I have no minde to differ from any one; yet, if I have <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in conſcience joyn with them in this their ſuppoſition. Neither can we imagin how thoſe caſes of <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> can give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they are applyed unto the former <hi>texts</hi> which require <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:115689:110"/>Are we to give <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which commands obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> rightly qualified, only in caſe of <hi>ſcandal?</hi> or can we conceive that under <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to <hi>lawful Magiſtrates</hi> in <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things,</hi> there is no more to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then, if there be no <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> by <hi>inobedience,</hi> no <hi>contempt</hi> by <hi>diſobedience?</hi> Shall we think he hath no <hi>power</hi> in things <hi>indifferent?</hi> for if his <hi>power</hi> be only in the <hi>puniſhing</hi> of thoſe who are <hi>breakers</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>rewarding</hi> of thoſe that are <hi>obſervers</hi> thereof; then is our <hi>obedience</hi> injoyned to him only <hi>paſſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, if the queſtion be thus ſtated, <hi>whether humane laws do binde the Conſcience;</hi> in theſe terms ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely taken, it is denied: becauſe we are aſſured that no <hi>man</hi> hath of himſelf any <hi>authority</hi> over the <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> and becauſe we cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that that which is <hi>commanded,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115689:111"/>by virtue of his command is <hi>right,</hi> but if the queſtion be ſtated thus, <hi>Whether we are bound in conſcience to obey a lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in lawful commands,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the former reſpects; I have no ſcruple ſufficient againſt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative.</p>
               <p>One Argument may be this,</p>
               <p>All <hi>Gods Commandements</hi> doe binde in <hi>conſcience.</hi> That we ſhould be <hi>obedient</hi> to <hi>humane laws</hi> is one of <hi>Gods Commandements;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we bound in <hi>conſcience</hi> to be <hi>obedient</hi> to <hi>humane laws;</hi> becauſe we are bound to <hi>Gods law</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. By the <hi>Law Divine</hi> we are obliged in <hi>conſcience</hi> to them by manner of the <hi>object</hi> of the thing. If we compare the <hi>humane law</hi> with the <hi>Divine law</hi> touching it, the <hi>humane law,</hi> in the whole, is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered but as a particular matter of the <hi>Divine law.</hi> And if we be bound in <hi>conſcience</hi> to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115689:111"/>
                  <hi>all</hi> matters of it, how ſhould we not be bound to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>this?</hi> So that if we do not <hi>obey,</hi> we do not offend a <hi>weak brother</hi> only, but the great <hi>God,</hi> by whom <hi>Kings</hi> reign.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are more bound to our <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Parents,</hi> then <hi>children</hi> are bound to their <hi>natural Parents.</hi> But <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> are bound in <hi>conſcience</hi> to their <hi>natural Parents;</hi> ſo then we are bound in <hi>conſcience</hi> to our <hi>Civil Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> That we are more ſubject to our <hi>Civil Parents,</hi> appeareth in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral regards; becauſe firſt the dayes we are <hi>preſerved</hi> in, are more happy then thoſe we were <hi>born</hi> in, ſince <hi>the condition of our birth is uncertain,</hi> as the <hi>Orator</hi> ſaith well. 2. The <hi>natural Parent</hi> hath not <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> over the <hi>childe,</hi> as the <hi>Civil Parent</hi> hath; which is given him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by <hi>God,</hi> as is noted; ſince the <hi>people,</hi> even upon ſuppoſal of <hi>election,</hi> cannot give him <hi>this;</hi> as

               </p>
               <p>Now for the Aſſumption, that <hi>children</hi> are bound in <hi>conſcience</hi> to be <hi>obedient</hi> to their <hi>parents,</hi> who, in conſcience, can deny; ſince they have this impreſſion in them by <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> which bindes the <hi>natural conſcience,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo their <hi>obedience</hi> hath a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>promiſe</hi> annexed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>God,</hi> that they ſhould be obedient to them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> there is to be expounded by <hi>obedience</hi> in the firſt verſe. Now
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115689:112"/>what <hi>promiſe</hi> can we ſay is made by <hi>God,</hi> but in order to ſuch <hi>obedience</hi> as we are not in <hi>conſcience</hi> free to? Indeed they ſhould be <hi>obedient to their parents in the Lord,</hi> as in the text. But this doth not derogate from their due <hi>obedience,</hi> but doth <hi>qualifie</hi> it. It doth not <hi>abate</hi> their <hi>ſubjection</hi> in thoſe things wherein they ſhould be <hi>ſubject,</hi> but doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain</hi> the <hi>extenſion</hi> of it.

               </p>
               <p>Thus, in brief, as towards our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to <hi>laws Civil,</hi> and the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p>But ſome there are who will make a difference betwixt our obliged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>laws Civil</hi> and <hi>laws Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this in few, and in way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Firſt, with us, the <hi>ſupreme
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115689:113"/>authority</hi> for the conſtitution of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiastical</hi> things is the <hi>ſame;</hi> and therefore there can be no <hi>difference</hi> on that part.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Eccleſiaſtical conſtitutions</hi> which have the ſame <hi>authority</hi> with us, in regard of their original iſſue of <hi>Supreme power;</hi> are like to binde as much as <hi>Civil,</hi> by reaſon of as great aſſiſtance to be preſumed for the framing of them, as for the framing of thoſe which are <hi>political:</hi> ſince we have a promiſe from <hi>Chriſt</hi> of his bleſſing ſucceſſively to the greateſt actions, to be ſure, of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the end of St. <hi>Matthew, I will be with you to the end of the world;</hi> which doth not only reſpect <hi>Credends,</hi> but

                  <hi>Agends</hi> alſo. And there is a reaſon of ſuch <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> in order to the third propoſition.</p>

               <p>TO commend now <hi>goodneſs</hi> to ſome ſorts of men with a little more <hi>ſingular</hi> reſpect, will make an end. For this is the <hi>way</hi> to our <hi>end.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was to have a <hi>copy</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> (and ſome will ſay he was to have the beſt copy, ſuch as with <hi>points</hi>) that he might <hi>read</hi> in it diligently, and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> it for <hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>others.</hi> As

It is <hi>natural</hi> for men to love but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoſe who are <hi>above</hi> them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men have no minde to be <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> and therefore have more need
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115689:116"/>of it: and alſo they would not ſeem to have ſuch <hi>imperfections</hi> as might make them fit for <hi>obodience.</hi> And therefore how brave were it, that as the <hi>authority,</hi> ſo the <hi>worth</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> were unqueſtionable; ſo as no man might <hi>covet</hi> his <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> his <hi>rule.</hi> And it would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if their <hi>ſubjects</hi> would not ſuſpect them the more, becauſe they have ſo much <hi>liberty;</hi> or that <hi>Princes</hi> would not take their <hi>liberty.</hi> And they have the leſs reaſon to <hi>take</hi> it, becauſe they <hi>have</hi> it. <hi>He is a good Prince,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whoſe vices do not exceed his virtues:</hi> but ſhould we northen love him, who is not yet charged with any <hi>vice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is too lofty a Theme for a deducted ſtyle. It is fit there ſhould be thoſe who by their place and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſhould more move them at leſs diſtance.</p>

               <p>But to preſs the ingagements of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> upon theſe great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages is rather meet for thoſe (and ſuch there have been) who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Nobles</hi> to be <hi>Clerks.</hi> Theſe may ſpeak home.</p>
               <p>As for me; my minde is towards the <hi>Clergy</hi> of theſe Kingdoms; in whom ſurely <hi>virtue</hi> is moſt <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi>
